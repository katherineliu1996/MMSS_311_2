On Friday — the first day of Mr. Modi’s second term, and the same day the White House terminated a special trade status for India — the Indian government had reported that the country’s economy was growing at the slowest rate in five years and that unemployment was at a 45-year peak. Mr. Modi and his new ministers responded with two acts that illustrated their top priority: reinvigorating the Indian economy. With farmers suffering across the country, the first act of the new cabinet was to extend a program of cash handouts to cover 20 million more farm workers — a sector that Mr. Trump wants to open to more competition from American growers. The second was to create a pension system for small traders, a group battered by competition from India’s leading e-commerce sites, which are owned by the American giants Amazon and Walmart. “What the U.S. is trying to do is bully India on certain issues where India cannot take a decision in favor of the U.S.,” said Ashwani Mahajan, a leader of the Swadeshi Jagran Manch, a populist organization affiliated with Mr. Modi’s party. The group has pushed the government to pass policies favoring small Indian companies and farmers over foreign multinationals. The termination of the special trade status, which had eliminated tariffs on a small portion of India’s exports to the United States, had long been expected. The move, taken late Friday, was seen as the Trump administration’s way to break a monthslong impasse in trade talks. But like Mr. Trump, Mr. Modi has embraced nationalist language and policies. Neither leader is likely to bend soon, and the Indian government made clear on Saturday that it would put its own country’s interests first. “We have significant development imperatives and concerns, and our people also aspire for better standards of living,” the Ministry of Commerce and Industry said in a statement. “This will remain the guiding factor in the government’s approach.” Mr. Trump’s move against India closely followed another volley in his administration’s trade war, a hemisphere away. On Thursday, Mr. Trump said he would impose a 5 percent tariff on all imported goods from Mexico beginning June 10, and threatened to raise those tariffs if Mexico did not take action on undocumented migrants traveling toward the United States. While Mexican officials were largely surprised by the announcement, Indian leaders were anticipating the trade action from the Trump administration, which had been considering it for a year. The end of the preferential trade status, which takes effect Wednesday, will not in itself have a major economic impact in India. India exported $83.2 billion in goods and services to the United States in 2018, but just $5.6 billion benefited from the zero-tariff designation for certain developing countries, known as the Generalized System of Preferences. The main industries affected will be textiles, jewelry and auto parts. Trump administration officials view the move as delivering on their promise to rewrite the trade rules for countries they believe have not sufficiently opened their markets to American producers. “Mr. Trump is ticking all the boxes, basically: China done, Japan alerted and now India,” said Harsh V. Pant, a professor of international relations at King’s College London. “With this decision, Mr. Trump is getting into election mode.” In India’s case, the administration is seeking stronger protections for American companies’ intellectual property; lower tariffs on imported medical devices and electronics; the opening of India’s markets to American dairy products; and an easing of India’s recent protectionist measures against American technology and financial companies. Mr. Trump has focused particularly on India’s high tariffs on imported Harley-Davidson motorcycles. And senior trade officials want to close the $24.2 billion trade deficit the United States had with India in 2018. “The U.S. expectation is now that the election is over, Modi can do more on subsidies,” said Sreeram Chaulia, dean of the school of international affairs at O.P. Jindal Global University outside New Delhi. At the same time, with Mr. Trump poised to begin his own re-election campaign, “the U.S. wants to be seen as militant on trade to appeal to the base of Trump,” Mr. Chaulia said. “They are not backing down.” Mr. Modi, who campaigned on a nationalist platform, is under pressure from his backers to protect Indian companies and jobs. Some of India’s largest manufacturers are smarting under Mr. Trump’s tariffs on their aluminum and steel, while mom-and-pop stores complain they are losing customers to Amazon. The country’s internet companies, including the telecommunications giant Reliance Jio, are pushing the government to curb the power of American tech giants like Facebook and Google, whose services dominate Indian smartphones even more than they do American ones. India is also chafing at the American trade embargo on Iranian oil. India and Iran have a centuries-old trade relationship, and India says oil from Iran is a bit cheaper than from other countries. In recent months, India has raised tariffs on certain categories of imported products, and it has threatened to impose tariffs on American nuts, apples and finished metal items. Still, as Mr. Modi tries to revive his country’s sluggish economy, his administration will have to court some of the same foreign manufacturers and investors that are pressuring the Trump administration to take a tougher line with India. Rajiv Kumar, the vice chairman of NITI Aayog, an agency that helps the Indian government plan and execute major projects, said the government is likely to announce a series of “big bang” moves over the next 100 days to make India a more attractive place to do business. “We have to focus on accelerating growth,” Mr. Kumar said. “We have to make the investment climate as friendly as possible, to deliver on what the prime minister has promised and replace the red tape with the red carpet, both for domestic and foreign investors.” Much of the burden for finding common ground will fall on India’s new external affairs minister, the career diplomat Subrahmanyam Jaishankar. A former ambassador to the United States and to China, Mr. Jaishankar led years of delicate negotiations with the United States over civilian nuclear development, navigating treacherous politics in both countries to reach an agreement. “Jaishankar is going to try to cut a bilateral deal with Trump,” Mr. Chaulia predicted. “The problem with Trump is that no deal is a done deal.”"

If the tariffs materialize, consumers could fee… [+1656 chars]",the-new-york-times,The New York Times,"When trade tensions with China flared last year, many companies sought refuge in a country with a long, stable relationship with the United States: Mexico. Now, that alternative for production and materials may also be in jeopardy with President Trump’s threat to impose escalating tariffs on imports from Mexico, aimed at forcing action on illegal immigration. In the short term, the tariffs would mean lower profits for American importers and higher prices for American consumers on everything from avocados to Volkswagens. In the long run, they could force companies to reconsider the continent-spanning supply chains that have made North America one of the world’s most interconnected economies. That disruption, experts warn, could be far more damaging to the United States economy than the cost of tariffs themselves. The United States imported more than $345 billion in goods from Mexico last year, and shipped $265 billion the other way. But if anything, those numbers understate the interdependence. American refiners process crude oil from Mexico, then sell it back as gasoline. Automakers ship parts back and forth repeatedly during manufacturing. About 30 percent of the content of Mexican exports originated in the United States, according to a recent study. “Our ties to Mexico are in many ways much more immediate than China and in some ways much more powerful,” said Pete Guarraia, who leads supply chain consulting for Bain. “I don’t think there’s much you could do to mitigate the effects because the changes required would be so substantial.” Mr. Trump has frequently criticized Mexico and the American companies that relocate production there. But his trade policies have largely focused on China, a target of successive rounds of tariffs on billions of dollars in imports. American companies have responded by moving production and supply chains out of China, in some cases to Mexico, which so far this year has displaced China as the United States’ top trading partner. The attraction of doing so only increased when the United States, Mexico and Canada reached a deal last fall to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement. Now, those plans have been thrown into turmoil. “Mexico was the place that people were looking to move to,” said Joseph Fitzgerald, a partner in Deloitte’s supply-chain practice. “Now it’s, ‘Gosh, we just got through one wave of supply chain strategy and structural change and now we need to start a new round.’” BD, a medical technology company, said last month that it was moving some of its manufacturing to Mexico from China in part because of the Trump administration’s tariffs. Troy Kirkpatrick, a BD spokesman, said Friday that the company was still in the process of making the shift, involving diagnostic devices and other products, and was assessing the latest tariff announcement. Mr. Trump said in a Twitter post on Thursday evening that he would impose a 5 percent tariff on Mexican imports on June 10, and ratchet it up to 25 percent by October if the immigration issues were not resolved. If the tariffs materialize, consumers could feel them almost immediately, most likely starting with the price of fresh fruits and vegetables — a competitive market with slim margins where distributors would have little choice but to pass on costs. “As a consumer, that was my first thought,” said Emily Blanchard, an economist at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College. “Those are my avocados and strawberries. What are you doing?” For other products, the reverberations could be more gradual. Companies may initially absorb some of the costs to avoid losing business, particularly on higher-margin items, or ones where they face competition from domestic producers. But economic research shows that consumers eventually bear the brunt of tariffs. The impact could be greater in the case of trade with Mexico because so many imports from there contain parts or materials from American factories. “We’re taxing ourselves on our own goods,” said Katheryn Russ, an economist at the University of California, Davis. Economists said the direct effects of a tariff of 5 percent or even 10 percent would probably be small, especially with a strong economy and low inflation. The larger threat, they said, was the disruption they could cause for automakers and others who have come to rely on supply chains that seamlessly cross international boundaries. Those supply chains will not fray overnight, said Brian Dunch, a trade expert at PricewaterhouseCoopers. But over time, they could break down, particularly if companies decide they cannot trust trade rules to be consistent from one year to the next. “It’s the cumulative effect of all this uncertainty,” Mr. Dunch said. “You’ll see supply chains Balkanize.” No industry better symbolizes the integrated North American economy than the automakers. And no industry stands to lose more if that integration breaks down. General Motors has three Mexican plants that make some of its most important models, including the highly profitable Silverado and Sierra pickup trucks and the new Chevrolet Blazer sport-utility vehicle. G.M. and Fiat Chrysler rely on Mexico for about a quarter of their North American production, and Ford for 10 percent. Some foreign automakers are even more reliant on Mexico. Volkswagen, for example, makes Golfs and Jettas there for the United States market, and almost half of the cars Nissan makes in North America are built in Mexico. Tariffs could also disrupt production in some auto plants north of the border because manufacturers operate complex cross-border supply chains. Many parts and components used in Mexican plants come from the United States, and vice versa. “It’s safe to say that in terms of auto manufacturing, the U.S. and Mexico are not trading with each other so much as they are building the same products together,” said Kristin Dziczek, vice president for industry, labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich. Tariffs, “would significantly raise the cost of building cars in the U.S. and burden supply chains that have been built up over decades,” she said. “The industry doesn’t have piles of cash laying around to build up new production capacity in the United States.” NEAL E. BOUDETTE Tariffs could also mean higher prices at the pump. Imports of Mexican oil have been in decline in recent years, but the United States still purchases more than 700,000 barrels of crude a day from Mexico, 8 percent of total imports. A 5 percent tariff would add $3 a barrel — a cost that experts said was likely to be passed on to consumers in prices for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. “It’s the American driver who is going to suffer the consequences,” said Bruce S. Appelbaum, chairman of Mosaic Resources, a Houston consulting firm serving oil and gas investors. Tariffs would pose a particular challenge for American refineries on the Gulf Coast that have been tooled to process heavy crude from Mexico, Venezuela and Canada. Adding to the challenge: Venezuelan oil imports have been shut off by Trump administration sanctions. Mexico buys more than a million barrels of American petroleum products a day, providing as much as $20 billion in revenue to American-based energy companies annually. Those sales could be threatened if Mexico retaliates with its own tariffs, although doing so would be costly: Mexico benefits from the low cost of American energy products. The natural gas trade will also be affected. About 20 pipelines send up to five billion cubic feet of American gas a day to Mexico, with more flowing in liquefied form by tanker. A shortfall in gas sales to Mexico would depress gas prices, but it could also mean a slowdown in pipeline construction and the loss of construction jobs. “This is a symbiotic relationship he is throwing a monkey wrench at,” Steven Pruett, chief executive of Elevation Resources, a West Texas oil company, said of Mr. Trump. “It’s very disruptive to business and planning.” CLIFFORD KRAUSS The United States imported nearly $28 billion in food and drink from Mexico last year, including more than two-fifths of its total imports of fruits and vegetables. Tariffs on those goods are likely to show up in higher prices in produce sections and grocery shelves within weeks. American farmers face the risk of retaliatory tariffs from Mexico — again. It was just two weeks ago that Mexico and Canada agreed to lift tariffs on American agricultural products that they had imposed in response to the administration’s tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Now American farmers are facing the prospect of a renewed trade war. “It’s very disappointing because we just got the tariffs removed,” said Michael Nepveux, an economist at the American Farm Bureau Federation, “so it’s very concerning to see things heading in the direction that they’re heading.” President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico has so far demurred on pushing the confrontation further. But the possibility of retaliation remains, and any Mexican tariffs could be damaging. Agricultural and food exports to Mexico totaled $19 billion in 2018, according to the United States Department of Agriculture. Of the top five exports — which include corn, soybeans, beef and dairy products — pork and pork products were most affected by the previous round of Mexico’s retaliatory efforts. During the first quarter of this year, for example, pork exports across the southern border dropped by $109 million, compared with the same three-month period in 2018. “This is hitting agriculture once again at a very vulnerable time,” said Todd Hultman, a lead analyst at DTN, an agriculture news and data service. China, for example, the largest buyer of American soybeans, has virtually halted purchases amid heightening tensions. PATRICIA COHEN Mr. Trump’s tariff announcement sent a jolt through medical device makers, which in recent years have built facilities in places like Tijuana that produce items like pacemakers, artificial respirators and intravenous bags. Last year, the United States imported medical equipment from Mexico worth nearly $8 billion, according to government trade statistics. Blair Childs, a senior vice president for public affairs at Premier, a company that buys supplies for hospitals and other health care providers, said many medical items were kept off the list of products that were subject to the first set of tariffs on imports from China. But now the list of Chinese products is expanding, meaning medical products from both China and Mexico could be hit with new levies. “We’ve been scrambling to try and figure out what might this mean,” Mr. Childs said. “We’re completely focused on trying to avoid price increases.” PETER EAVIS"

More than a billion hungry consumers. A cheap source of labor. A competitor, partner, supplier and security risk. Now add this: A foe bent on retaliation. The Chinese government said Friday that it was putting together an “unreliable entities list,” a counterattack against the United States for denying important technology to Chinese companies. No companies were named or details given, but tech firms seemed all but assured of being a prime target. As the economic relationship between the two countries frays at warp speed, the much-anticipated tech cold war is escalating. “If China continues to push back, and we continue to push back, there will soon be dual technology standards,” said Rebecca Fannin, author of the coming book “Tech Titans of China.” “Prices will probably rise for components, which companies will pass along to consumers. But both sides will strengthen their innovation edge, and that helps the global economy.” Some Silicon Valley companies are more vulnerable than others. Because Facebook and Google are blocked by the Chinese government, social media and search might be kept out of the conflict. Apple, on the other hand, is heavily invested in China, which is both a major manufacturer of the iPhone and a major market for it. Tesla is building a plant in Shanghai that will produce 250,000 cars a year. Venture capitalists have poured in funding. Microsoft’s research lab in Beijing is its largest outside the United States, while many of the products in the Amazon shopping mall are made in the country. Amazon also just opened an A.I. lab in China. The consequences of the deteriorating relationship are already playing out with smaller tech companies. Two weeks ago, the Trump administration put Huawei, the giant Chinese maker of telecommunications gear, on an “entity list” that would force it to get permission to buy technology from American companies. Huawei relies on American-made parts for everything from its smartphones to its networking equipment. Although it received a 90-day waiver to allow time for negotiations, many companies based in the United States have already severed ties. That has had a knock-on effect. Lumentum, a Silicon Valley company that makes optical networking gear, said Huawei was generating about 15 percent of its revenue. Last week, it reduced its expectations for the current quarter by about $35 million to a maximum of $390 million. Qorvo, a semiconductor company in North Carolina, also said last week that it depended on Huawei for about 15 percent of its sales and projected that its revenue in the current quarter would drop by about $50 million to a maximum of $750 million. China is a big and fast-growing consumer of computer chips, used in an array of products that include smartphones, personal computers, communications equipment and server systems. Customers in the country accounted for about 34 percent of global sales in 2018, which totaled $468.8 billion, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. China’s importance to American chip makers is magnified by the fact that many chips are sent to China to be assembled to make gadgets for customers elsewhere, such as the iPhones that Taiwan-based Foxconn makes for Apple in China. Roughly 60 percent of semiconductors sold are connected to the Chinese-based supply chain, the consulting firm KPMG said. Chip makers hope that the latest barbs between China and the United States are mainly aimed at gaining leverage in trade talks, not permanent changes in how the countries will have to do business. “Each volley in the U.S.-China trade dispute causes semiconductor companies to wince and financial markets to wobble, while pushing us farther from a deal that would benefit both economies, the two largest in the world,” John Neuffer, the Semiconductor Industry Association’s president and chief executive, said Friday after news of China’s unreliable entities list. “We urge both sides to avoid further escalations, get back to the negotiating table and reach a high-standard, enforceable and sustainable agreement,” Mr. Neuffer added. Apple’s exposure to China is broad. The company assembles most of its products there, and the region is its No. 3 market, after the United States and Europe. In its latest quarter, Apple earned $10.2 billion in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, or about 18 percent of its total revenue. Apple did not respond to requests for comment on Friday. The iPhone maker’s dependence on China was vividly demonstrated late last year when Chinese consumers began balking at buying the latest model of the smartphone. Total revenue for the region that includes China dropped 25 percent in the fourth quarter to $13.17 billion. One of Apple’s responses was to cut Chinese prices of its cheapest phone. The situation seems to have stabilized recently. Other tech behemoths have found little traction in China. Microsoft has generally tried to play along in China, censoring sensitive topics the government bans on its Bing search engine and teaming up with a state-run firm to produce a government-approved version of its Windows 10 software. Yet in January, government censors appeared to briefly block Bing, which, though little used, provides a rare portal in China to the global internet. And widespread problems with bootleg copies of Microsoft’s software have prevented China from becoming a major market for the company. Microsoft declined to comment. “Piracy has been an epidemic for Microsoft in China,” said Dan Ives, a managing director at Wedbush Securities. Investors had hoped that trade negotiations with China could resolve these longstanding intellectual property issues. “You are talking about a company that tried to penetrate China from every angle, both from a demand and R & D perspective,” Mr. Ives said. “Now, with all the trouble they have had there, it actually becomes a benefit to Microsoft versus other tech players.” Facebook, which needs all the friends and arguments it can get as it battles widespread calls for its breakup, has already seized on the China threat. It maintains it needs to be big to compete with the big Chinese companies. “People are concerned with the size and power of tech companies,” Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, recently said in a CNBC interview. “There’s also a concern in the United States about the size and power of Chinese tech companies and the realization that those companies are not going to be broken up.”"

The stock market stumbled Friday to its first losing month of 2019 in May, primarily due to President Donald Trump's decision to broadly wield his tariff powers, first against China over trade and then against Mexico over immigration. During stocks' month-long slide investors wrestled with the potential impact that the U.S.'s escalating trade war with China could have on corporate and economic growth. Friday's losses came after Trump announced plans via Twitter to impose tariffs on Mexico in a bid to compel the nation's third-biggest trading partner to crack down on migrants attempting to enter the U.S. The move shocked investors and spurred a broad sell-off that sliced more than 350 points from the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The selling left the benchmark S&P 500 index 6.6% lower for the month, and up 9.8% for the year so far. ""Clearly the markets were blindsided and completely caught off guard,"" said Cliff Hodge, director of investments for Cornerstone Wealth. It was only a month ago that the S&P 500 hit a record high and underlined its claim as the longest bull market for stocks on record, at more than a decade long. The market had climbed steadily through 2019 amid rising investor confidence that a deal with China was at hand and that the Federal Reserve would not tip the economy into recession by raising interest rates too aggressively. But when the first weekend of May arrived, Trump's tweet threatening more tariffs on China upended months of calm in the market. Investors are now preparing for a much longer and messier resolution to the global trade war than they were expecting just a few weeks ago. The trade conflicts have also clouded the global economic outlook, with many economists now forecasting U.S. growth to weaken in the coming months. That's likely to weigh on corporate profits this year. ""What you had over the last few days really is an increase in global uncertainty, and the economic data has been poor and weakening,"" said Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager with Globalt Investments. ""With rising costs as a result of tariffs and rising uncertainty, that's definitely going to have a damper on earnings."" The S&P 500 index fell 36.80 points, or 1.3%, to 2,752.06. It's the first time the S&P 500 has dropped for four straight weeks since autumn 2014. The Dow lost 354.84 points, or 1.4%, to 24,815.04. The Nasdaq slid 114.57 points, or 1.5%, to 7,453.15. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies gave up 20.04 points, or 1.4%, to 1,465.49. Major stock indexes in Europe also fell. ""You had a market that was feeling as though President Trump would want to do a deal so that the economy would not be hurt,"" said Martin. ""And now the behavior is indicating that he will use (tariffs) to accomplish his goals and seems less concerned about the actual economic impact."" Since the end of April, investors have sought out safer investments like utilities and bonds. Technology stocks, which led gains all year, were among the month's biggest losers. The technology heavy Nasdaq shed 7.9%, while technology companies within the S&P 500 lost 8.9%. Utilities, which have lagged the market, fell only 1.3% in May, making them among the month's best performers. Meanwhile, real estate stocks posted a 0.9% gain, the only winners this month. The new tariffs on Mexican goods shocked investors who were already nervous about a global trade war crimping economic growth. The new front in the trade war hit automakers particularly hard. Many of them import vehicles from Mexico. General Motors slid 4.3% Friday, while Fiat Chrysler dropped 4.8%. Ford Motor lost 2.3%. Banks also declined as higher bond prices pushed yields lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note slid to 2.13% from 2.22% late Thursday. Investors have been shifting money into bonds over concerns that economic growth will be crimped by the ongoing trade war. Lower bond yields drag down interest rates, making lending less profitable for banks. Citigroup fell 2.3% and Bank of America lost 2.1%. Energy companies sank following another broad slide in oil prices. Occidental Petroleum fell 4.1% and Valero Energy dropped 3.4%. Investors have been fleeing to safer holdings all month. The shift to utilities and bonds quickened earlier in May after the U.S. and China broke off negotiations. The U.S. then pushed more tariffs on Chinese goods along with a ban on technology sales. That prompted retaliatory tariffs from China and threats over other key resources. While the U.S. economy grew at a solid 3.1% annual rate in the January-March quarter, many economists now think growth is likely to weaken in coming months. They cite a range of threats facing the U.S. economy, including escalating trade conflicts, more cautious spending by consumers and businesses, and a global economic slowdown. On Friday, a report showed China's factory activity slowed in May as the trade war between Washington and Beijing escalated. Economists say China may be drawing up its own list of retaliatory targets among U.S. companies. The worry is that a trade war fought on multiple fronts around the world will be a drag on corporate profits and on a U.S. economy that's been supported by a solid job market. That worry pulled the yield on the 10-year Treasury note to its lowest level since the summer of 2017. That's left long-term Treasury yields below some short-term yields, an unusual occurrence that many investors see as a warning sign of recession. Investors are also raising their bets that the Federal Reserve will need to cut interest rates later in 2019 to help the economy, less than a year after it had been raising rates to get them closer to normal. ""The fact that the president is willing to use tariffs as a weapon can really cause damage to business confidence,"" Hodge said. ""You've got to be wondering, who's next?"" Energy futures closed broadly lower Friday. Benchmark U.S. crude tumbled 5.5% to settle at $53.50 a barrel. Brent crude oil, the international standard, closed 3.6% lower at $64.49 per barrel. Wholesale gasoline slid 4.1% to $1.80 per gallon. Heating oil dropped 3.8% to $1.84 per gallon. Natural gas gave up 3.7% to $2.45 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold gained 1.4% to $1,311.10 per ounce, silver added 0.5% to $14.57 per ounce and copper fell 0.5% to $2.64 per pound. The dollar fell to 108.41 Japanese yen from 109.55 yen on Thursday. The euro strengthened to $1.1171 from $1.1135. ___ AP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed to this article."

Corn prices are rising as surging floodwaters and soaking rains — combined with President Trump’s trade war with China — are making it an exceptionally difficult year for farmers facing risky choices about what crops to plant, or whether to plant at all. “It’s probably the most complicated decision season I’ve ever seen,” said Wallace Tyner, a professor of agricultural economics at Purdue University. So far this year, farmers have planted only two-thirds of the corn they would have been expected to by now, based on the previous five years. And with their fields still wet or underwater, the window for planting corn is closing. The resulting rise in commodities prices could eventually mean higher food costs in the nation’s grocery stores. Yet the standard decisions facing most grain farmers are already trickier than usual this year, as a result of President Trump’s escalating trade dispute with China, one of the most important foreign markets for agricultural products from the American Midwest.  Earlier in May, Mr. Trump imposed a 25 percent tariff on $200 billion of Chinese imports and threatened to do the same for another $300 billion. In response, China has cut back on its imports of agricultural goods from the United States. To help farmers, the Trump administration has offered assistance payments designed to offset lost income from the trade war. However, those payments will be calculated on how many acres of crops a farmer plants this year — which means any cutbacks in planting due to floods or rain will hurt farmers even more, by reducing eligibility for the government assistance. And there is yet another complicating factor. Often, farmers who aren’t able to plant corn choose soybeans instead, which can be planted later in the year. But that strategy might not make sense this time around, given China’s retreat from buying America’s soybeans.  The American Farm Bureau Federation has urged the Department of Agriculture to change the way it sets the assistance payments, according to John Newton, the group’s chief economist. The bureau wants acres that can’t be planted to count toward a farmer’s eligibility for federal assistance. Don Lehe, a farmer with 5,000 acres near Lafayette in western Indiana, said he would ordinarily be done planting his corn by now, but this year has put in just 20 percent so far. Mr. Lehe, who is 71 years old, said he’s never seen conditions this bad before. He said he still hopes to be able to plant, and might go with soybeans instead of corn despite the concern about China. “The longer you wait, you’re going to take a hit on yields,” Mr. Lehe said. “The water gets away, and then we get another rain.” Even if the administration changes the policy determining how farmers get assistance payments, the floods and rain have caused other problems that will continue to ricochet through the economy. The most obvious effect will be on prices. Corn futures have jumped since mid-May, increasing by about one-quarter. Those prices will lead to higher costs for some foods. “Where it would be felt most immediately is through milk, meat and eggs,” said Scott Irwin, a professor of agricultural marketing at the University of Illinois.  Those changes could take several months to appear, though, as livestock producers respond to higher feed prices by breeding fewer animals. Another unknown is the effect of the flooding on grains that have already been harvested and are being stored by farmers. If water gets into those storage bins, those crops can no longer be used for food, animal feed or even ethanol, Mr. Newton said. It’s still too soon to know the extent of damage to stored crops. The greatest concern may be what happens if the Midwest suffers more such severe floods and rains in future growing seasons. Scientists say the increase in average surface and air temperatures over time is likely to lead to increasingly extreme precipitation patterns.  While it’s not possible to definitively attribute any given storm or flood to the changing climate, Mr. Irwin pointed out, the recent activity in general “is consistent with more extreme climate events.” The question is whether, and how much, farmers are able to adapt to what seems likely to become the new normal, according to Jim Mintert, director of the center for commercial agriculture at Purdue. Mr. Mintert listed the changes that some farmers in Indiana have made to prepare for more extreme rainfall, including spending money on systems to help drain their fields more quickly and experimenting with different types of cover crops.  Still, he said that whether farmers are able to cope with a future of more frequent heavy rain and floods is “an open question.” For more news on climate and the environment, follow @NYTClimate on Twitter."

[Want more Canada coverage in your inbox? Sign up for the Canada Letter newsletter.] Silver reminded the assembled reporters that Dr. James Naismith, who invented basketball, was originally from Ontario. He also noted that the first N.B.A. game took place in Toronto, at the old Maple Leaf Gardens, in November 1946. The New York Knickerbockers defeated the Toronto Huskies, 68-66. Yes, believe or not, the Knicks won a game. And sure, the Huskies folded one year later. But that was all beside the point. “This,” Silver said, “is a homecoming of sorts for basketball in Canada.” A homecoming because the finals are in Toronto — and in Canada — for the first time, with the Raptors taking on the two-time defending champion Golden State Warriors. I’m Scott Cacciola, an N.B.A. reporter for The Times. Since coming on board in 2013, I’ve been casually (and sometimes not so casually) watching the growth of basketball in Canada. It’s become hugely popular thanks to a number of factors: more opportunities for children to play the game, an international push made by the league, the fact that virtually anyone with an internet connection can watch N.B.A. games anytime they want. The game has gone global, and Toronto has become something of a basketball hub. It’s gotten to the point where more top N.B.A. draft picks are coming out of Toronto than nearly any other North American city. Not to be overlooked, though, is the impact of the Raptors themselves, who arrived on the scene in 1995 and have slowly built a huge following that ranges from Nav Bhatia, a car salesman and self-described Raptors “Superfan” whom I profiled a couple of seasons ago, to the rapper Drake. In addition to sitting courtside for games at Scotiabank Arena, where he regularly gets under the skin of opponents, Drake even has an official role with the organization: global ambassador. But the team has helped legitimize the sport in a city that, for so long, has been synonymous with hockey. On Thursday, during a break between the first and second quarters, a bunch of retired Raptors were introduced to roars of appreciation from the crowd — players like Morris Peterson, Chris Bosh, Tracy McGrady and Dell Curry, a former shooting guard whose son Stephen now stars for the Warriors. (Worth noting: A young Stephen Curry dominated opponents for his Toronto-area middle school while his dad was playing for the Raptors toward the end of his career.) Meanwhile, in an area outside the arena, thousands of fans had packed the aptly named “Jurassic Park” for a huge watch party. Many had lined up since the morning, just so they could view a broadcast of the game together on giant screens. It was another sign of how much the Raptors mean to the city, and how firmly entrenched the game is here. Of course, the Raptors’ run to the finals has been especially rewarding for fans because of the team’s tortured postseason history. For years, the Raptors had fallen short of reaching the finals — in large part because they kept running into LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference playoffs. But James’s decision to join the Los Angeles Lakers last summer opened the door for the Raptors, and they capitalized. The question going forward is whether the Raptors can keep their roster intact. Kawhi Leonard, their star forward, will be a free agent this summer with his choice of suitors. On Thursday, though, none of that mattered as the Raptors stormed to a 118-109 victory in Game 1 of the best-of-seven series.

Mr. Shanahan barely mentioned China by name during a speech to a gathering of Asian military officials on Saturday, although he warned Beijing that “behavior that erodes other nations’ sovereignty and sows distrust of China’s intentions” should stop, in a clear reference to China’s militarization of disputed islands in the South China Sea. “The United States does not seek conflict, but we know that having the capability to win wars is the best way to deter them,” Mr. Shanahan said. At the same time of Mr. Shanahan’s speech, the Pentagon released a report criticizing what it characterized as China’s aggressive moves in the region. In fact, the deep tensions between Washington and Beijing showed no signs of abating on Friday. China remained on track to impose retaliatory tariffs of 20 to 25 percent on a slew of American products starting Saturday. That move makes China a full combatant in the trade war launched by President Trump. During a 20-minute meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Mr. Shanahan asked that the Chinese military work to enforce United Nations Security Council sanctions against North Korea. Mr. Shanahan’s spokesman, Col. Joe Buccino, said in a statement that the two men had “discussed ways to build military-to-military relations that reduce the risk of misunderstanding and miscalculation between our nations.” Those are standard talking points for meetings between top officials who don’t have much to say to each other, and the Pentagon statement did not mention a list of contentious issues, including tariff increases, the fight over the Chinese technology giant Huawei, American weapons sales to Taiwan or China’s militarization of the South China Sea. In Beijing, a former top Chinese official denounced what he called the administration’s “bullying and America first” policy. According to Reuters, Dai Xianglong, a former chief of the Chinese central bank, told a seminar in Beijing that President Xi Jinping of China and Mr. Trump would find it “difficult” to make much progress in the trade fight when they meet in a few weeks. Ahead of his speech at the annual Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, and just before he met with China’s minister of defense, Wei Fenghe, Mr. Shanahan told reporters that he would call out bad behavior by China. He complained — as American officials routinely do — that China’s installation of surface-to-air missiles and long runways for military aircraft on disputed islands in the South China Sea is “overkill.” The Chinese defense minister will be making his own speech in Singapore on Sunday, so he gets to follow Mr. Shanahan. And he also was expected to complain about what China views as American expansionism on its doorstep. After the meeting on Friday between Mr. Shanahan and Mr. Wei, American officials released a statement calling the session “constructive and productive.” Mr. Shanahan, the statement said, “hopes to build on this evening’s discussion with future engagements.” That’s the same thing Mr. Shanahan’s predecessor, Jim Mattis, said last October, when he met with Mr. Wei in the same room of the same Singapore hotel and posed for pictures with him in front of what looked to be the same potted plants. At that meeting, held on Oct. 18, 2018, Mr. Mattis even invited Mr. Wei to Washington for a visit. But two months later, Mr. Mattis had resigned his post and now, five months after that, Mr. Wei was going through the same protocol with a new American defense secretary, albeit one who has not yet been confirmed. Mr. Shanahan’s confirmation hearing is expected in June, but no date has yet been set. He may face an uphill battle given concerns over his lack of military experience and his deep ties to Boeing, where he worked for 30 years. Kori N. Schake, a former national security aide to President George W. Bush and deputy director-general for the International Institute for Strategic Studies, noted that for the past two years, when Mr. Mattis attended the same conference in Singapore, his speeches were followed by skeptical questions from audience members, which include Asian defense ministers wanting to know whether he spoke for Mr. Trump when he talked about allies in the region and great power competition. Mr. Shanahan wanted to use his speech Saturday, which was in essence his Asia debut, to convince Indo-Pacific allies that their interests lie with the United States, not China. Defense officials billed the address as yet another “new” strategy for the region, meant to show how much the United States is focusing on Asia now after 18 years of fighting in the Middle East and Afghanistan. Whether the Asian allies will believe him is unclear. Ms. Schake noted the Trump administration’s recent decision to send an additional 900 American troops to the Middle East to combat what the administration is describing as a rising Iranian threat. That makes it hard, she said, for Asian allies to accept that the United States is really ready to shift its military priority to great power competition with China in Asia."

If … [+1231 chars]",the-new-york-times,The New York Times,"President Trump on Thursday threatened to hit Mexico with new tariffs, escalating his immigration fight with America’s largest trading partner. And with that, he showed, once again, that he’s ready to employ trade as an all-purpose tool for his policy goals. Mr. Trump is juggling multiple trade conflicts today, with allies and rivals alike. His demands, often first disclosed through Twitter, have caught trading partners off guard. Just eight months ago, Mr. Trump’s negotiators struck a deal with Mexican and Canadian officials that they said would replace the North American Free Trade Agreement. His new threat comes even before Congress has approved the deal, and signals to American partners that continuing disputes and threats are now the norm in global trade — at least as long as Mr. Trump is in office. Of course, Mexico isn’t Mr. Trump’s only target. Far from it. In fact, what he’s taking on is broader than any particular country. He is challenging the post-World War II consensus that free trade enriches the world. Here’s a look at the many fronts in Mr. Trump’s war on the world’s established trade relationships.  The clash with Beijing has been Mr. Trump’s biggest trade conflict and the one that has spooked economists and investors the most. It could affect more than $730 billion in goods and services that flow annually between the two countries.  For now, it has no end in sight. Talks broke down in early May after the United States accused China of backtracking from offers made earlier in the negotiations. Mr. Trump then raised tariffs to 25 percent from 10 percent on $200 billion a year in imports from China and threatened to target even more Chinese goods. China soon retaliated and is looking for other ways to strike back. That could mean using the value of its currency as a trade-war weapon or leveraging its hold on key minerals and processes that the world depends on. The effects could be huge if the trade war lingers or intensifies. American companies count on China for a significant share of their profits and for the critical role it plays in making many of the world’s goods. China needs the American export market to keep its economy going and wants advanced technology like computer chips and software from the United States to foster its economic development. Still, trade hawks within the Trump administration argue that the United States has grown too dependent on China and see decoupling the two countries as a long-term goal. Already many companies are rethinking their dependence on China. For China, any move to retaliate against the United States risks speeding up that process. President Trump has called the relationship between the United States and Japan “a treasured alliance,” and says he enjoys a close relationship with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. That hasn’t exempted Tokyo from his threats. Though he has postponed his decision, Mr. Trump still says he will put tariffs on Japanese auto imports unless the two sides reach a trade deal. The White House wants greater access to the Japanese market for American farmers and ranchers. He also wants Japanese automakers to build more factories in the United States so more cars can be assembled by American workers.  Striking a deal is crucial for Mr. Abe, whose yearslong effort to rev up Japanese growth faces a major challenge from an economic slowdown in China, a major buyer of Japanese equipment and goods. Adding to the political pressure on Mr. Abe, Mr. Trump has said any deal would wait until after Japanese elections in July. Criticism of Japan from Mr. Trump is hardly new. His comments in the 1980s, when Japan’s export machine was more widely perceived as an economic threat to the United States, suggest those early clashes helped form his views on trade. The Mexican conflict was supposed to be over. But on Thursday, Mr. Trump reignited trade tensions by threatening to impose tariffs on Mexico beginning June 10 unless it stops the flow of undocumented immigrants across the border into the United States.  If he follows through on the threat, severe disruptions could be felt on both sides of the border. Thanks in part to the tariffs on China, Mexico is now the largest trading partner for the United States, accounting for more than $150 billion in trade in the first three months of this year, according to IHS Markit Global Trade Atlas, a data provider. Trade has already been hindered because of shifts in how American personnel police the border, leading to longer waits. And just as he has with Japan, Mr. Trump has also threatened to put tariffs on imports of cars made in Mexico. A number of American and Japanese auto factories are in Mexico, with supply chains that run deeply into the United States. Mr. Trump’s threat calls into question the fate of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which the three countries hammered out last year as the successor to the North American Free Trade Agreement. Already the United States has lifted tariffs on metal imports from both Mexico and Canada as a way to get the deal ratified. But Congress has signaled some skepticism, showing how Mr. Trump — whatever the fate of his various conflicts — has changed the tenor of the discussion on trade in the United States.  The prospect of punishing tariffs from the United States has loomed for several months after steel and aluminum tariffs imposed last year rattled American allies in Europe.  Mr. Trump has contended that imports of foreign cars and car parts are causing harm to the American automobile industry and threatening national security. “The European Union treats us, I would say, worse than China. They’re just smaller,” he said in May. “They send Mercedes-Benzes in here like they are cookies.” He has threatened tariffs of 25 percent on the millions of foreign cars and car parts imported by the United States each year. The move could inflict damage in states like Alabama and South Carolina, which are home to big Mercedes-Benz and BMW assembly plants.  This past month, the White House put off a decision on imposing these tariffs, leaving six months to negotiate a trade deal to address the problem. The United States was already struggling in negotiations with the European Union, which has refused to consider demands to allow more American agricultural products into Europe. The Trump administration says a deal without agriculture would not pass Congress, but populist politicians in Europe have seized on some American products and practices — like the use of chlorine to sterilize chickens — to justify retaining trade barriers. Countries like France and Belgium have also balked at joining talks because of the Trump administration’s refusal in 2017 to sign a global pact on climate change. And leaders of the Green coalition in the European Parliament have said they will not sign trade agreements with countries that have not ratified the climate accord.  Last fall, Mr. Trump appeared to reach a settlement over trade differences with Canada with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the revised Nafta. Among other things, the pact is supposed to make it easier to sell American dairy products in Canada. But his announcement on Thursday could derail his efforts to secure congressional approval of the pact.  Canada has been in an uncomfortable middle ground in the trade war between the United States and China. It became the center of a diplomatic row after Canadian authorities arrested Meng Wanzhou, a top executive at the Chinese tech company Huawei who was wanted on fraud charges by United States officials. Perhaps in retaliation, China has arrested two Canadians and accused them of espionage, and has placed restrictions on some Canadian agricultural products.  “China and the United States have escalated their dispute, and Canada has been caught in the crossfire,” Carolyn A. Wilkins, senior deputy governor at the Bank of Canada, said in a speech on Thursday.  Mr. Trump has implied he would intervene in Ms. Meng’s extradition to the United States if it would help Washington land a trade deal with Beijing. But the new North American trade deal signed this past fall also included a clause, known as the “China clause,” which many saw as a blatant push to block any free-trade deal between China and Canada.

I first spoke with Shane Goplin, a sixth-generation farmer in west-central Wisconsin, in March, when trade negotiations between Washington and Beijing were progressing, however fitfully. I cover the national economy, and ever since trade tensions with China started heating up I had been talking with soybean farmers throughout the Midwest and South. China had been the largest buyer of American soybeans, and these farmers had borne the brunt of the economic pain set off by the spiral of tariffs and retaliation. With a deal seemingly within reach, I wanted to line up soybean farmers to interview so that the moment an agreement was announced, I would be able to report their initial reactions to the news and provide an in-depth look at their experiences over the past year. Two more months passed before President Trump announced on Twitter that he was ratcheting up the trade war and threatening to impose even stiffer tariffs on almost all Chinese imports. I called Shane. “That tweet cost me $40,000,” he said, explaining that the price of a bushel of soybeans plunged by more than 10 cents after the president’s threat appeared. “Every penny in the market is tens of thousands of dollars for me.” Shane was in his tractor when he spoke to me, planting corn, and when I asked if I could come out and join him in the cab he said yes. My flight from New York went through Chicago, and it was only when I saw four enormous muzzled German shepherds with federal K-9 handlers waiting to board the small puddle jumper to Eau Claire that I realized Vice President Mike Pence was headed there, too. He was stumping for the administration’s trade deal with Canada and Mexico, and the dogs were part of his protective detail. Shane knew another farmer, Joe Bragger, who was attending the vice president’s rally the next day, so we arranged to have dinner afterward with Joe and his family at their home. Once that was taken care of, we could return to planting corn. Shane’s John Deere 8335R tractor is equipped with state-of-the-art GPS and can pretty much direct itself, automatically aligning the rows of seeds being planted. Yes, I wanted to drive it. (Though when I learned a new one sold for $330,000, I understood why he wasn’t eager for me to take the wheel.) Shane told me about his family’s history as farmers in the area, which stretched back to the 1850s when his ancestors first arrived as immigrants from Norway. We talked about weather cycles; the effect of a cold snap on early corn (it’s like the brain freeze headache that strikes when you eat ice pops too fast); commodity prices and loans; his wife’s teaching job, his three daughters and white deer hunting; why he voted for Mr. Trump; the impact of tariffs; federal farm aid; and China’s leaders. Then we drove off to the next field. “Growing up, the last thing I wanted was to be a farmer,” he said. Now he loves it. “I don’t know what else I’d do.” But it is a tough life. Over the previous week, Shane had spent 125 hours in the tractor and had missed his daughter’s performance in a concert the night before. “No one should have to work this hard to make a living.” Shane said he and other farmers he knows wanted a businessman in the White House. Most important, he said, is that Mr. Trump “loves farmers.” “It makes me feel really good to hear Trump say farmers are important to this country,” he said. “That’s what makes me want to stick with the president.” And while he hopes the trade fight is settled soon, he doesn’t think trade is the “silver bullet” that is going to solve farmers’ problems. When heavy morning rains canceled the next day’s planting, I toured Countryside Cooperative’s grain elevator and storage bins, which Shane and farmers in the surrounding counties use. There, Mike Christenson, the agronomy supervisor, was dealing with the headache of getting dried fertilizer delivered since flooding had halted barge traffic in their region along the Mississippi. I drove across the river to Winona, Minn., to see the quieted grain terminals for myself. Shane and I met up later at the Bragger home. Joe Bragger had just returned from listening to the vice president speak at what he labeled “a whistle stop” at an equipment manufacturer. Like Shane, he was ready to support President Trump until the trade war ended, yet still believed the trade issue was only one front on which farmers were battling. “From the dairy side, it’s a distraction,” Joe said. Overproduction and drooping commodity prices, he said, are the real problems. When Noel, his wife, announced dinner was ready, I turned off my recorder, put down my notepad and sat down with the Bragger clan and Shane on the porch looking out over a part of his farm. There were lots of stories, laughs and ice cream. A perfect evening. The next day, I drove to the airport, dropped off my rental car and headed toward the terminal. There are only two flights that depart from Eau Claire each day, so I wasn’t all that surprised when I ran into a familiar face. It was Tuco, the dog who had sat across the aisle from me on the trip from Chicago a few days earlier. We were both headed home.

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration said Friday that it has lifted a summertime ban on the use of E15, a gasoline blend made of 15 percent ethanol. The move is designed to help corn and soybean farmers harmed by President Trump’s decision to impose tariffs. Ethanol, made from corn and other crops, has been mixed into some types of gasoline for years as a way to reduce reliance on oil, among other things. However, burning ethanol-blended fuel in the summertime heat has a side effect of increasing smog — and for that reason the lifting of the ban raised objections from environmentalists. Oil companies also criticized the ending of the summertime ban because a wider use of ethanol will cut into their sales of gasoline.  Nevertheless, the change has the potential to reap political benefits for Mr. Trump as he gives the agriculture industry a policy change it has long sought. The formal lifting of the ban follows through on a promise Mr. Trump made to farmers on a trip to Iowa last fall, as he sought to shore up support for Republicans in the Midwest. The ban has been in place since 2011 and Mr. Trump has criticized it as “ridiculous.” “I appreciate President Trump’s steadfast support for our patriotic farmers and for his commitment to expand the sale of E15 and unleash the full potential of American innovation and ingenuity as we continue to demonstrate our rightful place as the world’s leader in agricultural and energy production,” the Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a statement. The summertime ban “made it very difficult to market E15,” said William Wehrum, the head of the clean air office at the Environmental Protection Agency, which administers the ethanol regulations. “We think this will result in increasing the amount of ethanol blended into gasoline.” Oil refiners are required to blend some ethanol into gasoline under a pair of laws, passed in 2005 and 2007, intended to lower the use of oil and greenhouse gas pollution by mandating increased levels of ethanol in the nation’s fuel mix every year. However, since passage of the 2007 law, the mandate has been met with criticism that it has contributed to increased fuel prices and has done little to lower greenhouse gas pollution.  Farm groups cheered the move.  “Removing outdated barriers and regulations is a commitment that this administration continues to make good on,” said Zippy Duvall, president of the American Farm Bureau Federation. “After years of declining farm income, opening up markets to additional fuel choices for consumers helps create new demand that farmers desperately need.” The oil industry and environmental groups criticized the move.  “Extending this waiver is an anti-consumer policy that risks causing costly engine and fuel-system damage to nearly three out of four vehicles on the road today,” said Frank Macchiarola, a vice president of the American Petroleum Institute, which lobbies for oil companies. “This premature policy attempts to push E15 into the market before it is ready.” Collin O’Mara, president of the National Wildlife Federation, said in a statement: “Allowing the year-round sale of E15 gasoline is both illegal under the Clean Air Act and will accelerate the destruction of wildlife habitat and pollution of our air, and drinking water.” It is expected that both oil companies and environmental advocates will challenge the move in court.

If … [+1227 chars]",the-new-york-times,The New York Times,"President Trump on Thursday threatened to hit Mexico with new tariffs, escalating his immigration fight with America’s largest trading partner. And with that, he showed, once again, that he’s ready to employ trade as an all-purpose tool for his policy goals. Mr. Trump is juggling multiple trade conflicts today, with allies and rivals alike. His demands, often first disclosed through Twitter, have caught trading partners off guard. Just eight months ago, Mr. Trump’s negotiators struck a deal with Mexican and Canadian officials that they said would replace the North American Free Trade Agreement. His new threat comes even before Congress has approved the deal, and signals to American partners that continuing disputes and threats are now the norm in global trade — at least as long as Mr. Trump is in office. Of course, Mexico isn’t Mr. Trump’s only target. Far from it. In fact, what he’s taking on is broader than any particular country. He is challenging the post-World War II consensus that free trade enriches the world. Here’s a look at the many fronts in Mr. Trump’s war on the world’s established trade relationships.  The clash with Beijing has been Mr. Trump’s biggest trade conflict and the one that has spooked economists and investors the most. It could affect more than $730 billion in goods and services that flow annually between the two countries.  For now, it has no end in sight. Talks broke down in early May after the United States accused China of backtracking from offers made earlier in the negotiations. Mr. Trump then raised tariffs to 25 percent from 10 percent on $200 billion a year in imports from China and threatened to target even more Chinese goods. China soon retaliated and is looking for other ways to strike back. That could mean using the value of its currency as a trade-war weapon or leveraging its hold on key minerals and processes that the world depends on. The effects could be huge if the trade war lingers or intensifies. American companies count on China for a significant share of their profits and for the critical role it plays in making many of the world’s goods. China needs the American export market to keep its economy going and wants advanced technology like computer chips and software from the United States to foster its economic development. Still, trade hawks within the Trump administration argue that the United States has grown too dependent on China and see decoupling the two countries as a long-term goal. Already many companies are rethinking their dependence on China. For China, any move to retaliate against the United States risks speeding up that process. President Trump has called the relationship between the United States and Japan “a treasured alliance,” and says he enjoys a close relationship with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. That hasn’t exempted Tokyo from his threats. Though he has postponed his decision, Mr. Trump still says he will put tariffs on Japanese auto imports unless the two sides reach a trade deal. The White House wants greater access to the Japanese market for American farmers and ranchers. He also wants Japanese automakers to build more factories in the United States so more cars can be assembled by American workers.  Striking a deal is crucial for Mr. Abe, whose yearslong effort to rev up Japanese growth faces a major challenge from an economic slowdown in China, a major buyer of Japanese equipment and goods. Adding to the political pressure on Mr. Abe, Mr. Trump has said any deal would wait until after Japanese elections in July. Criticism of Japan from Mr. Trump is hardly new. His comments in the 1980s, when Japan’s export machine was more widely perceived as an economic threat to the United States, suggest those early clashes helped form his views on trade. The Mexican conflict was supposed to be over. But on Thursday, Mr. Trump reignited trade tensions by threatening to impose tariffs on Mexico beginning June 10 unless it stops the flow of undocumented immigrants across the border into the United States.  If he follows through on the threat, severe disruptions could be felt on both sides of the border. Thanks in part to the tariffs on China, Mexico is now the largest trading partner for the United States, accounting for more than $150 billion in trade in the first three months of this year, according to IHS Markit Global Trade Atlas, a data provider. Trade has already been hindered because of shifts in how American personnel police the border, leading to longer waits. And just as he has with Japan, Mr. Trump has also threatened to put tariffs on imports of cars made in Mexico. A number of American and Japanese auto factories are in Mexico, with supply chains that run deeply into the United States. Mr. Trump’s threat calls into question the fate of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which the three countries hammered out last year as the successor to the North American Free Trade Agreement. Already the United States has lifted tariffs on metal imports from both Mexico and Canada as a way to get the deal ratified. But Congress has signaled some skepticism, showing how Mr. Trump — whatever the fate of his various conflicts — has changed the tenor of the discussion on trade in the United States.  The prospect of punishing tariffs from the United States has loomed for several months after steel and aluminum tariffs imposed last year rattled American allies in Europe.  Mr. Trump has contended that imports of foreign cars and car parts are causing harm to the American automobile industry and threatening national security. “The European Union treats us, I would say, worse than China. They’re just smaller,” he said in May. “They send Mercedes-Benzes in here like they are cookies.” He has threatened tariffs of 25 percent on the millions of foreign cars and car parts imported by the United States each year. The move could inflict damage in states like Alabama and South Carolina, which are home to big Mercedes-Benz and BMW assembly plants.  This past month, the White House put off a decision on imposing these tariffs, leaving six months to negotiate a trade deal to address the problem. The United States was already struggling in negotiations with the European Union, which has refused to consider demands to allow more American agricultural products into Europe. The Trump administration says a deal without agriculture would not pass Congress, but populist politicians in Europe have seized on some American products and practices — like the use of chlorine to sterilize chickens — to justify retaining trade barriers. Countries like France and Belgium have also balked at joining talks because of the Trump administration’s refusal in 2017 to sign a global pact on climate change. And leaders of the Green coalition in the European Parliament have said they will not sign trade agreements with countries that have not ratified the climate accord.  Last fall, Mr. Trump appeared to reach a settlement over trade differences with Canada with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the revised Nafta. Among other things, the pact is supposed to make it easier to sell American dairy products in Canada. But his announcement on Thursday could derail his efforts to secure congressional approval of the pact.  Canada has been in an uncomfortable middle ground in the trade war between the United States and China. It became the center of a diplomatic row after Canadian authorities arrested Meng Wanzhou, a top executive at the Chinese tech company Huawei who was wanted on fraud charges by United States officials. Perhaps in retaliation, China has arrested two Canadians and accused them of espionage, and has placed restrictions on some Canadian agricultural products.  “China and the United States have escalated their dispute, and Canada has been caught in the crossfire,” Carolyn A. Wilkins, senior deputy governor at the Bank of Canada, said in a speech on Thursday.  Mr. Trump has implied he would intervene in Ms. Meng’s extradition to the United States if it would help Washington land a trade deal with Beijing. But the new North American trade deal signed this past fall also included a clause, known as the “China clause,” which many saw as a blatant push to block any free-trade deal between China and Canada.

President Trump plans to impose a 5 percent tariff on all imported goods from Mexico starting June 10, then “gradually increase” it until the flow of undocumented immigrants across the border into the U.S. stops, the NYT reports. • “Tariffs would be raised to 10 percent on July 1 ‘if the crisis persists,’ and then by an additional 5 percent each month for three months.” • “They would remain at 25 percent until Mexico acted.” Exactly what it would have to do is unclear. • Mexico is Washington’s largest trading partner, and sent the U.S. $346.5 billion of goods last year — 5 percent of that is more than $17 billion. Mr. Trump has “essentially dared” Mexico to risk economic catastrophe on both sides of the border if it’s not willing to meet his demands, the NYT writes. The tariffs could be hugely damaging. They could upend supply-chain dynamics, exact a serious toll on American consumers and corporations, and potentially derail the renegotiation of Nafta. They could even make a trade deal with China less likely, some analysts said. “Markets reacted quickly. The Mexican peso weakened against the American dollar, while shares of Japanese automakers fell because many of them have manufacturing facilities in Mexico.” And U.S. stock futures are down this morning. An obvious question: Where does this end? Tariffs are already in place on imported metals and Chinese goods, and there’s a looming threat of auto tariffs, too. “This whipsaw diplomacy weakens America’s ties with its allies and causes capital to hunker down and wait for more predictable times,” David Fickling of Bloomberg Opinion writes. More: The U.S.-China trade war is reshaping supply chains in ways that will be hard to reverse. Metal tariffs raised consumer prices but created a few thousand jobs. China reportedly has a rare earth minerals attack plan. (The Pentagon is trying to reduce fallout from such a move, while Bloomberg Opinion argues that the threat is overrated.) And the U.S. is still letting a few countries import some Iranian oil. If inflation and global risks worsen, the central bank’s officials could rethink their cautious stance on interest rates, the NYT’s Jeanna Smialek reports. That’s according to the Fed’s vice chairman, Richard Clarida. During a speech in New York yesterday, he suggested that a persistent shortfall in inflation below a 2 percent target or big threats from global economic and financial developments could factor into a “call for more accommodative policy.” The Fed has little to gain by signaling rate cuts, because the storm clouds could disperse if the U.S. and China strike a trade deal at the Group of 20 summit meeting in Osaka, Japan, late next month. “But if the meeting does not produce a path toward an agreement, the Fed might find that it needs to respond,” Ms. Smialek writes. “Mr. Clarida is just one of 17 Fed officials — albeit an important one — and his remarks are hardly a battle cry for rate cuts,” Ms. Smialek writes. “But they are a sign that the Fed’s top brass is watching global developments warily.” New inflation data is due out this morning. “While it is possible that the trade war could temporarily lift prices, the Fed is likely to overlook that as a one-off shock or could even welcome it,” Ms. Smialek writes. More: The bond market is screaming that investors want a rate cut. The business software giant is telling stores to stop selling assault-style rifles  if they want to keep using its products, Jay Greene of the WaPo reports. • “The pressure Salesforce is exerting on those retailers — barring them from using its technology to market products, manage customer service operations and fulfill orders — puts them in a difficult position,” Mr. Greene writes. • “Camping World, for example, spends more than $1 million a year on Salesforce’s e-commerce software, according to one analyst estimate. Switching to another provider now could cost the company double that to migrate data, reconfigure systems and retrain employees.” • The change affects “a small number of existing customers when their current contracts expire,” as well as all new customers, a Salesforce spokeswoman told Mr. Greene. • It’s the latest move by Salesforce to take a stand on political and social issues. The company’s C.E.O., Marc Benioff, has been outspoken on immigration, religious freedom and homelessness. • But some industry advocates called Salesforce’s approach “corporate-policy virtue signaling” that discriminates against gun owners, according to Mr. Greene. A $1 billion quarterly loss and slowing revenue growth made Uber’s first earnings report as a publicly traded company painful. But there were bright spots. Sales growth is leveling off. First-quarter revenue grew 20 percent from the same time a year ago, down from 25 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018. It was Uber’s slowest quarterly growth rate in two years, something it warned would happen as it grew. Competition is growing around the world, especially in important new businesses like food delivery. That will continue to force Uber to spend money — hence the big losses. Nelson Chai, the company’s C.F.O., told analysts, “We will not hesitate to invest to defend our market position globally.” One glimmer of hope: Price wars appear to be receding. “We’ve more recently seen signs of competition becoming more focused on brand and products, versus incentives,” Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber’s C.E.O., said on the analyst call. Another: Uber’s newer businesses are succeeding.  Sales for Uber Eats meal delivery more than doubled from a year earlier; those for its freight division more than tripled. Shares in Uber rose nearly 2 percent in after-hours trading yesterday. More: Why Uber’s earning report is so confusing. How ride-hailing could hurt mass transit. And people are freaking out about Uber’s plans to ban riders with low customer ratings. The financier accused Occidental Petroleum of pushing for a “fundamentally misguided” and “hugely overpriced” $38 billion takeover of Anadarko — putting himself up against a fellow billionaire, Warren Buffett. Carl Icahn has a nearly 5 percent stake in Occidental, and wants to know more about how the transaction came about. Remember that Occidental outbid Chevron in a closely watched M.&A. contest. Chevron had offered $33 billion for Anadarko, but Occidental (which had pursued Anadarko for months) came back with its $38 billion proposal. Mr. Icahn also dislikes Warren Buffett’s involvement. To help pay for the transaction, Occidental agreed to sell $10 billion in preferred shares to Berkshire Hathaway, which will cost nearly $1 billion a year in annual dividends. Mr. Icahn concedes that he probably can’t stop the deal, but he is threatening to call a special shareholder meeting to elect new board members. Occidental defended the deal, saying that the Anadarko purchase would create “compelling” shareholder value. But its shares fell slightly yesterday after Mr. Icahn sued. JPMorgan Chase reached a tentative settlement in a class-action case begun by a father who was denied the 16-week paid parental leave that the company began offering in 2016, Noam Scheiber of the NYT reports. • “As part of the proposed settlement, the company will take steps to ensure that its policy is administered in a gender-neutral way.” • “And it will create a $5 million fund to compensate up to about 5,000 fathers who were shortchanged in the past.” • Experts said the settlement, if approved by a judge, “would be the first to result from a class-action case brought by employees.” • “This gives an incentive for other workers to come forward” at other companies, said Peter Romer-Friedman of the firm Outten & Golden, one of the lawyers representing the plaintiffs. HSBC reportedly plans to cut hundreds of jobs at its investment bank. Rob Lloyd will resign as the C.F.O. of GameStop, the video game retailer. Andrew Wolstenholme stepped down as the head of the naval and armored vehicles division at BAE Systems after just a year in the role.

The Fed left rates on hold after its April 30 and May 1 meetings, but that decision came again… [+1239 chars]",the-new-york-times,The New York Times,"Growing economic risks from President Trump’s trade war with China could prod Federal Reserve officials away from their patient stance and toward cutting interest rates. The central bank was already grappling with low inflation — price increases have hovered below officials’ 2 percent target for most of this 10-year expansion — when Mr. Trump’s trade spat with China intensified this month, rattling markets and threatening global growth. If those risks continue or intensify, they might persuade the Fed to consider taking steps to bolster the economy, including a potential rate cut. “If the incoming data were to show a persistent shortfall in inflation below our 2 percent objective or were it to indicate that global economic and financial developments present a material downside risk to our baseline outlook,” officials would take that into account in assessing whether interest rates should continue to remain unchanged, the Fed’s vice chairman, Richard Clarida, said during a speech in New York on Thursday. Later, in response to a question, Mr. Clarida said that although the economy was in a good place, “if we saw a downside risk to the outlook, then that would be a factor that could call for more accommodative policy.” Mr. Clarida is just one of 17 Fed officials — albeit an important one — and his remarks are hardly a battle cry for rate cuts, but they are a sign that the Fed’s top brass is watching global developments warily. The central bank has little to gain by signaling to investors that a policy change is imminent, because President Xi Jinping of China and Mr. Trump are expected to meet at a Group of 20 summit meeting in Osaka, Japan, late next month. Risks could quickly dissipate if they strike a deal. But if the meeting does not produce a path toward an agreement, the Fed might find that it needs to respond. “If we’re on a bad track following the June G-20, we would expect that naturally to be accompanied by worsening business confidence and further tightening in financial conditions via equity markets and the dollar,” said Krishna Guha, the vice chairman of Evercore ISI. “It seems to me more likely than not that we would see rate cuts in the fall in that scenario.” The Fed’s most recent decision to leave rates on pause — announced May 1 — came against a backdrop of fading trade tensions and improving economic data. Talks between the United States and China collapsed shortly after that, and Mr. Trump has since ramped up his trade war by raising tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods while threatening to tax an additional $300 billion worth. Financial conditions have since tightened, based on a Goldman Sachs index. The Fed watches such gauges to get a sense of how market turmoil might feed into the real economy. Worsening financial conditions toward the end of 2018 were, in part, what prompted the central bank to shift away from gradual rate increases and toward a patient stance early this year. “They are watching how the financial market is processing the trade war, and I think that’s an important input into their processing of downside risks,” said Michael Feroli, the chief United States economist at J.P. Morgan. If there is a second 2019 pivot, economists say, it could happen fairly abruptly. “Your sense is that forward momentum in the economy is fine, but it may not be so strong that you would be willing to ignore survey and market indicators and wait until the hard data shows a big trade impact,” Mr. Guha said. “The fact that this is like the anti-1970s — the deep underlying concern is inflation that’s too low — that certainly has to lower the threshold for the Fed to cut rates.” Bond markets are increasingly betting that rate cuts are coming as growth begins to slow from Germany to Australia and as inflation expectations move lower both domestically and abroad. “I judge that, at present, indicators suggest that longer-term inflation expectations sit at the low end of a range that I consider consistent with our price-stability mandate,” Mr. Clarida said. The Fed’s preferred inflation measure showed that prices climbed 1.6 percent in the year through March, stripping out volatile food and fuel indexes. The Fed aims for stable 2 percent gains, and wants to miss to the upside as often as it misses to the downside. Fresh inflation data will be released on Friday morning in Washington. While it is possible that the trade war could temporarily lift prices, the Fed is likely to overlook that as a one-off shock or could even welcome it. Lael Brainard, a Fed governor, recently suggested that the central bank could seize on what she calls “opportunistic reflation” to prove to investors and consumers that it is serious about getting price gains back to — and even, for a time, above — 2 percent. In other words, an increase in import prices that pushes inflation north of the Fed’s goal would not prompt the central bank to act. Fed watchers would understand that officials mean it when they say they are happy to tolerate higher price increases, and inflation expectations would creep back up. “The Federal Reserve could use that opportunity to communicate that a mild overshooting of inflation is consistent with our goals and to align policy with that statement,” Ms. Brainard said in a speech this month.

It won’t last long,’” Mr. LaFrazia recalled. But nearly a year later, the trade war shows no sign of cooling off. So ControlTek, the electronics manufacturer that Mr. LaFrazia runs near Portland, is taking steps to protect itself, a strategic shift that has been repeated in boardrooms and executive suites around the world in recent weeks. ControlTek is rewriting contract language to make it easier to pass the cost of tariffs on to its customers. It is shifting supply chains out of China where possible, and redesigning products to avoid Chinese components where it isn’t. And as a tiny player in an enormous global industry, it is discovering that there is only so much it can do. “We’re very much at the end of the whip getting thrown around,” Mr. LaFrazia said. Despite dire warnings from economists, President Trump’s trade war has so far done little to derail the decade-long recovery from the Great Recession. Economic growth has remained strong, and the unemployment rate last month hit a 50-year low. But evidence is mounting that the conflict has taken an economic toll. The Commerce Department said Thursday that trade — both imports and exports — slumped in April, and data released earlier this week showed a sharp slowdown in manufacturing, amplifying a recent trend. The bond market in recent days has been sending signals that the trade war could be a threat to growth in the United States and globally. The impact could deepen if Mr. Trump follows through on his promise, made Thursday, to impose new tariffs on imports from Mexico. And as the conflict drags on, there are signs it is beginning to reshape the global economy in more fundamental ways. “There’s definitely lasting damage that has been done,” said Mary Lovely, a Syracuse University economist and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. “It’s not going to mean the end of the world tomorrow, but it’s death by a thousand cuts. How competitive is America going to be in 10 or 15 years?” Tariffs have not yet compelled businesses to return large-scale production to the United States, where labor and other costs tend to be much higher than in China and other overseas manufacturing hubs. But trade tensions are accelerating a corporate trend of shifting supply chains away from China. In a recent survey of more than 200 corporate executives by the consulting firm Bain, 42 percent said they expected to get materials from a different region in the next year, and 25 percent said they were redirecting investments out of China. More companies are likely to follow suit in coming weeks after the Trump administration moved to limit business with Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant, which the White House sees as a security threat. Many companies were initially reluctant to abandon longstanding supplier relationships over a trade dispute that could be over in months, choosing instead to absorb the tariffs or find ways to share the costs with suppliers and customers. Now some are re-evaluating those decisions. GoPro, the camera maker, said this month that it was shifting some production from China to Mexico. Universal Electronics, a manufacturer of remote controls, announced a similar move late last year. And Varex Imaging, a Utah-based maker of X-ray equipment, said this month that it was working to “redirect our supply chain away from China” in response to the tariffs. “Most companies took a wait-and-see attitude” at first, said Pete Guarraia, who leads Bain’s supply chain practice. “That was absolutely the mind-set. Now it’s: ‘I can’t wait any longer. I have to take some action.’” Electronics manufacturers could be among the first to feel the full brunt of the trade war. The industry is perhaps uniquely global: Chips made in Oregon or Texas are shipped to a plant in Mexico to be attached to circuit boards made in China alongside capacitors made in Vietnam. It is not unheard-of for a product or its components to cross the Pacific three or even four times before showing up on retail shelves. The crackdown on Huawei in recent weeks has opened a new front to the trade war. Huawei buys chips and other components from American manufacturers, and analysts warn that the fight could quickly spread to other companies. American companies sold more than $200 billion in computers and electronic goods to foreign buyers last year, including $18 billion to China. And while that was a small part of the United States’ $2.5 trillion in total exports last year, the broader tech sector has accounted for an outsize share of economic growth in recent years. Anything that disrupts the global supply chains the industry relies on could threaten American economic growth, said Torsten Slok, chief economist for Deutsche Bank. Semiconductor sales, he said, have proved to be a reliable indicator of the direction of the broader economy — and sales have been falling this year. “We will find out soon if the economy was strong enough to withstand this,” Mr. Slok said. If the electronics industry sneezes, few places will catch a cold as quickly as Portland. The industry employs close to 40,000 people in Oregon, including 20,000 at Intel, the state’s largest private employer. Oregon exported $2.7 billion in electronics goods to China last year, more than any state other than California — a total that doesn’t include companies, like ControlTek, that are just across the Columbia River in Washington State. Founded in 1971, ControlTek has weathered the rise of Japan and then China. Today, the company and its 140 employees don’t try to compete directly with the high-volume factories in China. Instead, ControlTek, like American manufacturers in other industries, has survived by carving out a niche based on quality and service. Its plant in Vancouver, Wash., has state-of-the-art machines that place components — integrated circuits, capacitors, resistors and other devices, some barely big enough to see with the naked eye — onto circuit boards destined for medical devices, aircraft and even pitching machines. But it also has employees hand-soldering parts beneath high-powered magnifying glasses, the kind of personalized attention that can look like an anachronism on today’s highly automated factory floors. When the first round of tariffs went into effect last year, ControlTek executives had no idea how they would be affected, or even how to find out. The software for tracking inventory showed the company’s suppliers, but not where those suppliers got their material. “I didn’t even know that was something you could find out,” Mr. LaFrazia said. It was also unclear which products were subject to tariffs. Mr. LaFrazia, a 54-year-old Air Force veteran, recalled spending hours poring over an online list of tariff codes to figure out which applied to his parts. When he called the manufacturers, they often didn’t know where they fell in the government’s taxonomy of tradable goods. Even the government’s experts can get confused — ControlTek recently had a shipment of parts delayed for 12 days because customs officials thought they contained aluminum that was subject to tariffs. (They didn’t.) Over time, ControlTek has learned to navigate the system. Suppliers are sourcing components from Vietnam, Malaysia and other countries where possible, and ControlTek has begun factoring the tariffs into its product designs. “We’ll design China out,” Mr. LaFrazia said. The longer the trade war goes on, the more companies will have to make such decisions. Thomas Isaac, president and chief executive of Allied Technologies International, an Oregon manufacturer of parts for the telecommunications and aviation industries, said he had all but given up on selling to China. Sales there have slowed “almost to negligible” since tariffs took effect, he said. But Mr. Isaac has seen more business from customers looking to keep their suppliers closer to home. Mr. Isaac spent more than a decade at General Electric before acquiring Allied Technologies five year ago, and he said he remembered the enthusiasm for globe-spanning supply chains. Now that optimism is fading. “The global supply chain sounded good for the last 20 years, but you’re already seeing companies pulling back and saying, ‘Let’s stay more local,’” he said. While companies may be rethinking their supply chains, Mr. Isaac said he did not expect to see production shift back to the United States in meaningful volumes, the stated goal of Mr. Trump’s policies. So far, the data backs him up. Imports from China have fallen precipitously since the trade war began, both in electronics goods and over all. But that decline has been offset by increased imports from other countries. The nation’s trade deficit has been largely unchanged. At ControlTek, tariffs have eaten into profit margins, although business as a whole hasn’t suffered. On one level, the trade war is no different from health care costs, labor issues or any of the other challenges that businesses encounter. But Stacey Smith, ControlTek’s vice president for human resources and marketing, said that for an American manufacturer, the tariffs were particularly hard to stomach. “The tariffs are different because it’s your own government,” she said. “I understand the negotiating tactics. But it really is quite painful to be one of the pawns.”"

Sign up here.) President Trump’s attention on trade has largely been focused on China in recent weeks. But there’s a growing sense that he could soon turn his fight to Europe. • The European trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmstrom, reportedly warned E.U. trade ministers that they “should brace” for U.S. tariffs on billions of euros worth of European goods over a dispute about Airbus subsidies, Politico reports. • A 180-day deadline that Mr. Trump had set for negotiations with the E.U. and Japan over car exports “holds to the president’s pattern of steadily increasing pressure on trading partners to cut a deal more to his liking,” Bloomberg argues. Mr. Trump may have spotted an opportunity to take advantage of Europe while it’s in disarray. • The results of the recent European Parliament  elections show that the Continent is increasingly polarized and fragmented, and that Brexit continues to be a distraction. • France and Germany — the bloc’s dominant powers — disagree on how to approach issues like agriculture and cars in trade talks, Bloomberg notes. What happens next is unclear: • The sides made little progress in talks in Washington and Paris this month, Bloomberg reports. • That leaves more muddling through or a sharp escalation as the most likely paths. • Escalating tariffs could damage both sides — but, as we’ve seen with China, that doesn’t mean they’re off the table. More: China has reportedly paused purchases of U.S. soybeans. Speaker Nancy Pelosi is  dragging out consideration of Mr. Trump’s updated North American trade deal. (Canada is moving to ratify it.) The rest of the world is worried about tariffs, but African nations are creating a free-trade zone. What happened when anchors from Fox and a Chinese state TV channel held a live debate on trade. And how other countries are trying to work around the power of the dollar. Markets fell slightly yesterday as the trade war between the U.S. and China dragged on. Not a lot new, or particularly worrying, there, right? But one continued market phenomenon is beginning to cause concern, according to Neil Irwin of the Upshot: an inverted yield curve in the bond market. • An inverted yield curve is when longer-term bond yields fall below those of shorter-term ones. For instance, the 10-year Treasury’s yield was 2.26 percent yesterday, while the 30-day Treasury’s was 2.35 percent. • “Historically it has been viewed as a sign of a recession in the offing,” Mr. Irwin writes. “At a minimum, it indicates that bond investors believe the Federal Reserve will soon need to cut interest rates — in effect, that it overshot with those four rate increases last year.” • So far, the stock markets have held up, given the specter of long-term tariffs. But, Mr. Irwin writes, “Economists may have been analyzing the trade war too narrowly, merely by calculating the cost of tariffs and where those costs may show up.” • “The potential long-lasting consequences are harder to model,” he adds, which explains why bond investors are more pessimistic than recent economics and earnings data might suggest. The two carmakers have promised that combining would create a company that is better equipped to survive the industry’s transition to electrification and autonomy. A merger might fix some problems, but it probably won’t solve all of them. It would help with electric cars and global distribution. Fiat would provide profitable S.U.V. and high-end car models, and a beachhead in America. Renault would bring electric-vehicle technology and a stronger European presence. And Nissan could help them become a global powerhouse. The Japanese carmaker is already in an alliance with Renault, and is warily studying the merger. Though worried about its independence, Nissan may have little choice but to link with Renault and Fiat in order to shore up its own declining operations. Such a move would give the new group a powerful reach. But the cost savings appear dicey. Renault and Fiat say they can save $5.6 billion by combining supply chains and sharing R.&D. costs. But that would happen over six years, during which the companies have pledged not to lay off employees. So the benefits may be harder to extract in practice. And auto mergers have a spotty record. Take Renault and Nissan: Despite teaming up in 1999, they use shared parts in only 35 percent of Nissan cars, far below an original target of 70 percent. Other alliances — Daimler and Chrysler, BMW and Rover — failed. That’s often partly because of clashes between management teams and cultures. There’s still reason to be hopeful. Fiat bought Chrysler years ago, and it has proved to be one of the few auto mergers that has succeeded. Facial recognition technology increasingly faces pushback around the world, most recently in San Francisco. But some companies are doubling down on sales across the United Arab Emirates, BuzzFeed News reports. • IBM is marketing biometric surveillance systems in the region, as are the Chinese giants Hikvision and Huawei. • At a recent government-organized conference in Dubai, representatives from those companies said they saw countries in the Persian Gulf “as an exciting market to sell their video analysis platforms, which they say can do everything from analyzing the behavior of groups to automatically blacklisting individuals based on their faces.” • “Police in Dubai have begun rolling out an ambitious program, dubbed Oyoon, the Arabic word for ‘eyes,’ that will implement facial recognition and analysis driven by artificial intelligence across the city,” though it isn’t clear what technology powers the tool. Critics of facial recognition are dismayed. “In a place like Dubai, where there is not much freedom of expression and people are being jailed for what they say, when you introduce artificial intelligence, it’s used by systems of power to reinforce their control over the population,” Sarah Aoun, a digital rights technologist who works with rights activists, told BuzzFeed. A new study by the Congressional Research Service throws cold water on the idea that the Trump administration’s 2017 tax cuts were a boon to U.S. economic growth. The cuts had little effect on wages or investment in 2018. Economists calculated that they contributed perhaps 0.3 percent to overall economic gains, according to Jeff Cox of CNBC. They didn’t pay for themselves, as President Trump claimed they would. To have done so, the economists write, the cuts would have had to cause a 6.7 percent increase in gross domestic product. The biggest winners are corporations. The cuts contributed to a surge in stock buybacks, Michael Hiltzik of the LAT writes. Meanwhile, companies’ tax bills fell to 12 percent from 23 percent. That led to a $40 billion drop in revenue for the U.S. government. “The growth effects tend to show a relatively small (if any) first-year effect on the economy,” the study’s authors wrote. “Although growth rates cannot indicate the tax cut’s effects on G.D.P., they tend to rule out very large effects particularly in the short run.” Most news coverage about the Trump administration’s block on sales of components and software to Huawei has focused on the Chinese company. But what does it mean for the suppliers? As many as 1,200 U.S. companies will be affected by the blacklisting, the FT reports, citing Huawei executives. Many are in two sectors: cybersecurity and semiconductors. (It’s worth noting that third-country suppliers will also be affected by the ban if U.S. components contribute more than 25 percent to the value of the goods they sell.) The total impact is unknown. But Huawei spent about $11 billion last year buying components and services from U.S. companies. Suppliers aren’t necessarily worried. “Even if we lose Huawei’s orders for base stations or smartphones, somebody else will have to make them and we’ll get that business,” Shoichi Tosaka, the C.E.O. of the Japanese electronics manufacturer Taiyo Yuden, told Bloomberg. More: Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia said that his country tried to use Huawei technology “as much as possible.” The company opened a 5G lab in South Korea today, to little fanfare. Silver Lake has hired Laura Anderson, who was most recently Intel’s head of global communications, for the same role. Bed Bath & Beyond named four independent directors to settle a fight with activist investors: John Fleming, formerly of Uniqlo; Sue Gove, the president of a retail consultancy; Jeffrey Kirwan, previously the C.E.O. of Gap’s namesake retail division; and Joshua Schechter, a financier. Two senior female partners at KPMG, Maggie Brereton and Ina Kjaer, resigned from the professional services company in February, reportedly over the firm’s handling of bullying accusations against a male colleague.

That’s what watching global financial markets the last couple of weeks has felt like. In a lot of ways, nothing looks particularly wrong. The S&P 500 was down 0.7 percent Wednesday, tumbling for a second consecutive session, but over all is down only about 5.5 percent from its early May high. The unemployment rate is at a five-decade low. With major companies nearly done releasing their first-quarter results, 76 percent had results above expectations. But along the way, global bond prices have soared, driving interest rates down sharply. Ten-year Treasury bonds are yielding only 2.26 percent as of Wednesday’s market close, down nearly a full percentage point since November 2018. The outlook for inflation in the years ahead is falling as well, as are the prices of oil and other commodities. Most significant, the fall in longer-term bond yields has not been matched by a fall in shorter-term rates. For example, a 30-day Treasury bill is yielding 2.35 percent — meaning you can earn more on your money tying it up for a month risk-free than you can tying it up for a full decade. This is not normal. It is called an inverted yield curve, and historically it has been viewed as a sign of a recession in the offing. At a minimum, it indicates that bond investors believe the Federal Reserve will soon need to cut interest rates — in effect, that it overshot with those four rate increases last year. There is also a soft underbelly to some of the good economic data of late. Orders for capital goods like business equipment fell 0.9 percent in April, suggesting companies may not be in an expansionary mood. The Institute for Supply Management’s index of activity at manufacturing companies fell sharply in the most recent reading, though it remained in expansion territory. The financial markets don’t always tell a tidy little story about what is happening, but here’s a theory about reconciling the apparent calm in the economy with the many worrying signs.  The breakdown in trade negotiations with China and the imposition of tariffs on Chinese goods are part of the story, but only a part. Businesses have weathered escalating tariffs for two years now, and while tariffs can be costly, they do not need to wreck the economy. After all, prices for products fluctuate for all sorts of reasons, and market economies are pretty good at adjusting. But what has happened in the last few weeks involves the specter of a longer, more painful form of damage. There have been signs that the world’s two largest economies might not simply be experiencing some tensions and trading a few tariffs, but could be heading toward a broader split. In a sense, economists may have been analyzing the trade war too narrowly, merely by calculating the cost of tariffs and where those costs may show up. The potential long-lasting consequences are harder to model. What if American regulators try to cut off Chinese companies’ access to Wall Street and its vast pool of financing, as some China hawks are advocating? What if China cuts off exports of the rare earths materials that are crucial to advanced manufacturing in the United States? Will the Trump administration’s ban of the technology giant Huawei be the first step toward a bifurcation of today’s global internet into American and Chinese spheres? Or it could even be this simple: If there is a slowdown in the Chinese economy that causes its demand for oil and other commodities to fall, American makers of those commodities could face pain over and above that caused by tariffs directly. Falling global commodity prices would pull the world economy even further into its deflationary rut. That last story is particularly consistent with the swings in markets this month. Because tariffs tend to increase consumer prices, you might expect the escalating trade war to cause investors’ expectations for inflation to rise. Yet the gap in prices between bonds that are indexed to inflation and those that are not suggests that investors envision annual inflation of 1.6 percent over the next five years, down from 1.8 percent at the start of May. There are further signs of trouble from around the world: threats of conflict with Iran, missile tests in North Korea. European politics is a mess. It can be a mistake to assume that financial markets are responding to the latest geopolitical headlines. But put it all together, and there’s less of a mystery about why bond investors are in a more pessimistic mood than the recent economic and earnings data might suggest makes sense. It is premature to assume that a recession or a geopolitical crisis is imminent. U.S.-China relations could enter another period of détente, the Federal Reserve could take a precautionary interest rate cut, and the economy and markets could once again be off to the races. In other words, we don’t know yet if this is a horror movie or a comedy, but in the months ahead it seems we’ll find out."

Both inside and outside the White House, there are growing calls for a weakening of China’s links to U.S. financial markets, Keith Bradsher and Ana Swanson of the NYT report. • “Some trade experts and others urging the Trump administration to keep a hawkish stance are discussing whether the White House should curb China’s access to Wall Street.” • A bipartisan group of senators urged the administration last month to increase disclosure requirements for Chinese companies listed in the U.S. if they pose national security risks or are complicit in human rights abuses. • Steve Bannon, Mr. Trump’s former chief strategist, has said that a lack of transparency about the ultimate owners of Chinese companies is problematic. • “The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq are breaching their fiduciary responsibility to institutional investors, the pension funds of hardworking Americans,” Mr. Bannon said. “It’s outrageous. All of it should be shut down immediately.” Adding urgency to the news: Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant, is now considering listing shares in Hong Kong, five years after its hugely successful I.P.O. in New York. (Its shares would trade in both markets.) The company has long considered that option, and unidentified sources told the NYT that geopolitical worries were not the driving force for considering the listing. It’s not clear if Mr. Trump wants to block China from U.S. markets. And for now, Chinese companies can still go public in America: Two weeks ago, Luckin Coffee, a Chinese rival to Starbucks, surged in its trading debut in New York, though its shares have since fallen. But China has a nuclear option: Sell some of its $200 billion worth of U.S. stocks, which would throw markets into turmoil. But that could also hurt the investment return on China’s assets. The Chinese technology company is ramping up its legal challenge to a freeze-out by Washington, as it continues to favor public spats over quiet negotiations, Paul Mozur of the NYT writes. • “The Chinese telecommunications giant filed a motion on Tuesday in the United States to accelerate its lawsuit against the White House.” • The lawsuit argues that a ban on U.S. government agencies buying its hardware “is unconstitutional because it singles out Huawei as a danger without giving it any chance to appeal.” • “The request for summary judgment could expedite an outcome without the costs and time of a full trial, including avoiding handing over sensitive corporate information during the discovery process.” • “It also could give the company a chance to present its arguments publicly in front of a judge in just a few months rather than wait for a trial to unfold.” It embarked on a media campaign, outlining its thinking in a WSJ op-ed and at a news conference at its headquarters in Shenzhen, China. This isn’t a new tactic: “Huawei has repeatedly turned to the American court system and press” in recent months, Mr. Mozur notes, including by offering “carefully managed and regularly scheduled interviews” with its founder, Ren Zhengfei. But so far Huawei has little to show for its aggressive approach, Mr. Mozur writes. More: South Korea is caught between the U.S. and China over the Huawei fight. Huawei’s biggest selling point: Its 5G prices are basically irresistible. And Mr. Ren said of speaking with Mr. Trump: “If he calls me, I may not answer.”  Fiat Chrysler’s proposal to merge with Renault has been lauded by investors and analysts. But Nissan, Renault’s Japanese partner, appears to be less enthusiastic. Renault executives kept Nissan in the dark about their talks with Fiat until days before the proposal was announced, the NYT reports. That probably aggravated existing tensions between the two companies over their alliance, which came to light after the arrest of their former mutual chairman, Carlos Ghosn. Nissan has long complained that Renault dominates their alliance, despite becoming the bigger partner. Nissan sold 5.5 million cars in its most recent fiscal year; Renault sold fewer than 4 million. A merger with Fiat could give Renault even more leverage over Nissan. The combined European carmakers would have nearly double the sales of Nissan, the FT reports. “It’s hell” for Nissan’s C.E.O., Hiroto Saikawa, whether he says yes or no to the Renault-Fiat deal, the analyst Koji Endo told the FT. But Nissan could benefit. It would have a 7.5 percent voting stake in a combined Renault-Fiat, versus its current 15 percent nonvoting stake in Renault. And Fiat and Renault would want the Japanese company’s electric-car technology and strong presence in China. So Mr. Saikawa may have some negotiating power. One unnamed investor told the FT: “What Nissan may have lost is a chance to be a dominant force in the merger, but they can preserve their independence.” While the U.S. economy is resilient, the picture overseas is gloomy, and profits at companies focused on the rest of the world are suffering, Stephen Grocer of the NYT reports. “A wide divide has developed in the performance between the companies with the most exposure to the rest of the world and those that are mostly focused on the United States.” • “At companies in the S&P 500 that draw more than half their revenue from abroad, first-quarter profits fell about 12 percent.” • “By contrast, earnings at firms that generate most of their sales within the United States grew about 6 percent.” The earnings slide was greatest for those with the largest exposure to the global economy and the escalating trade war between Beijing and Washington, including tech companies like Apple and semiconductor manufacturers. “The split could persist as the Trump administration ratchets up the trade war,” Mr. Grocer adds. “Wall Street analysts now expect profits at companies with the most overseas exposure to fall 1.4 percent in 2019, compared with a 6 percent increase for domestically focused companies. At the start of the year, analysts forecast that profits for those two sets of companies would grow 6.9 percent and 8.4 percent.” The novelist and ex-wife of Jeff Bezos is one of the latest signatories of the Giving Pledge, to which the rich promise to donate most of their wealth to charitable causes. Ms. Bezos will own a roughly 4 percent stake in Amazon once her divorce from Mr. Bezos is finalized in July. That’s worth about $36 billion as of yesterday’s close. “I have a disproportionate amount of money to share,” she wrote in a letter explaining her decision. “My approach to philanthropy will continue to be thoughtful. It will take time and effort and care. But I won’t wait. And I will keep at it until the safe is empty.” (Mr. Bezos praised the move, tweeting, “Go get ‘em.”) Her decision highlights how little Mr. Bezos gives. The Amazon founder has drawn criticism for donating little to charitable causes compared with peers such as Bill Gates, Warren Buffett and Michael Bloomberg. (His biggest donation to date: $2 billion last year, to help homeless families and preschoolers, which was made with Ms. Bezos.) And it reignited criticism of the Giving Pledge itself. Signatories have no legal obligation to follow through on their promises, and it’s hard to track their charitable donations. Other new additions to the Giving Pledge this year: • The WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton • The hedge fund billionaire Paul Tudor Jones • The British financier David Harding • The Coinbase founder Brian Armstrong President Trump proudly announced earlier this month that a buyer had been found for a shuttering G.M. plant in Lordstown, Ohio. But Nelson Schwartz, Matt Goldstein and Neal Boudette of the NYT write that there’s a lot of uncertainty about the factory’s potential savior. • The would-be buyer is a company affiliated with Workhorse, an electric vehicle maker.

19,Kevin Rudd,Trump Hands China an Easy Win in the Trade War,The president’s tough rhetoric plays into Chinese economic nationalism.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/29/opinion/trump-china-trade-war.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/29/opinion/29kevinrudd/29kevinrudd-facebookJumbo.jpg,5/29/19 10:00,"Even if a trade deal with the United States is still possible, some in the Chinese leadership are now starting to ask, why bother? They argue that in technology, investment, foreign policy, national security and human rights, the Trump administration has made… [+1703 chars]",the-new-york-times,The New York Times,"When President Trump tweeted on May 5 that the China trade deal was off, the historical echoes in Beijing were loud and clear.  Almost exactly 100 years earlier, China’s “May Fourth Movement” of 1919 was a direct response to the actions of President Woodrow Wilson at the end of World War I. Wilson had promised China, an American ally, that German colonies in Shandong would be returned to Chinese sovereignty, but instead handed them to Japan. China exploded with anti-American, nationalist sentiment. One of the eventual consequences was the establishment of the Chinese Communist Party, which for the last 70 years has ruled the country. Thus, Mr. Trump has handed Xi Jinping a remarkably effective nationalist card to play at a time when he has been under pressure at home because of a slowing economy. The Chinese media is now full of accounts of the country’s economic resilience and appeals to patriotism, even invoking the spirit of the Korean War, when, according to the official narrative, China was able to stare down the vastly superior American military.  And just in case people didn’t get the point, Mr. Xi recently visited Jiangxi, the starting point of the Long March in 1934, in which the Communist Party endured many hardships but ultimately emerged victorious.  I can almost hear members of the Trump administration groaning. Why on earth would they need to take into consideration events in China’s ancient past?  The answer depends on what Mr. Trump’s primary objective is. If it’s to sound tough to American voters, he may well have a winning formula. But if it’s to bring about a substantive change in China’s negotiating posture toward a bilateral trade agreement, one that might usher in changes in China’s trade policy, addressing questions of forced technology transfers, intellectual property theft, industrial subsidies, currency manipulation and a phalanx of other non-tariff barriers, I’m not so sure.  Days after the president’s tweets, China listed three “red lines,” positions the United States had taken in the trade talks that were unacceptable: First, that it would keep tariffs in place for a period after the proposed trade agreement was signed. Second, that it could impose punitive tariffs if it judged China to be in violation of the agreement, and that China would be forbidden from retaliating with its own tariffs. Third, the ever-inflating expectations of the terms under which Beijing would buy American goods under a proposed bilateral purchasing agreement.  These “red lines” were new. Before that, China’s negotiating team had a fully flexible remit from the leadership. But not anymore. Now that these three lines are in the public domain, there is no way Chinese leaders can yield on them. The leaks of large parts of the negotiating text to the American news media has added a new level of toxicity, making it virtually impossible to return to the existing text as a basis of negotiations. Together with recent moves against the Chinese telecom company Huawei presumably intended to pressure Beijing further, the possibility of negotiating a revised agreement that is more accommodating to American interests is now very slim. Instead, what I have seen in Beijing over the last few weeks is a country moving in exactly the opposite direction.  Economic analysts, meanwhile, have been calculating the impact of a full-blown trade war, estimating a loss of about 1.2 percentage points to Chinese G.D.P. growth. This figure is now portrayed in the Chinese media as entirely manageable given China’s capacity to use fiscal and monetary policy stimulus to support domestic demand and keep growth above 6 percent.  Even if a trade deal with the United States is still possible, some in the Chinese leadership are now starting to ask, why bother? They argue that in technology, investment, foreign policy, national security and human rights, the Trump administration has made it clear that it has embarked on a more adversarial position toward China. So why should Beijing expend any more political capital on a trade deal? Perhaps it’s better, in China’s view, to cut its losses now and get ready for the next Cold War. If that’s what the Trump administration wants, its strategy has been a great success. If not, and the president really wants a trade deal, with reasonable decreases in the bilateral trade deficit, and some substantive changes in Chinese economic behavior, the American negotiating strategy requires some serious recalibration.  Of course, China’s public position is that negotiations can continue. Even within the framework of the new “red lines,” there may still be room for a deal. China might agree to purchase more American goods, with America yielding on the retention of tariffs, and the unilateral right to impose tariffs later. However, the degree of difficulty in getting to an agreement has now increased substantially.  The bottom line is that nationalism is not just a factor in Trump’s America. It’s now a big factor in Xi Jinping’s China as well, reinforced through the prism of Chinese history. In most of its dealings with America over the last 100 years, China has seen itself as weak. Today, in Beijing’s view, China is weak no longer.  Kevin Rudd, a former prime minister of Australia, is president of the Asia Society Policy Institute in New York.

But it’s not as if the Trump team became more disciplined and tight-lipped in its second year. As Wolff explains in “Siege,” a number of the people who helped him on the first book have left the administration but are still in on the gossip loop, joining Wolff in what he calls “my train-wreck fascination with Trump — that certain knowledge that in the end he will destroy himself.” One of these people is Stephen K. Bannon, who gets pride of place in Wolff’s acknowledgments, thanked for “his trust and cooperation” as “the Virgil anyone might be lucky to have as a guide for a descent into Trumpworld.” Wolff says “it is a measure of Bannon’s character that he stood by his remarks in ‘Fire and Fury’ without complaint, quibbles or hurt feelings.” This is a strangely effusive measure of gratitude for Bannon, whom Wolff calls “the man arguably most responsible” for Trump’s presidency. After all, Bannon isn’t exactly known for holding traditional values like “character” and “trust and cooperation” in much esteem. “Siege” is ostensibly about Trump — portrayed here as a very unstable non-genius cracking under the pressure of being thrust into the highest office — but its guiding worldview looks remarkably like Bannon’s. It’s a mordant, readable tell-all designed to show how Trump, simply by being Trump, has made himself the perfect wrecking ball, blasting holes through an array of institutions. There are salacious details in this book — many of which Trump’s critics will want to eat up — though with so many unnamed sources, Trump’s compulsion for hyperbole and Wolff’s own journalistic record, it’s hard to know which tidbits to trust. It makes more sense to read “Siege” less as a news report and more as a rhetorical gambit — a twisted bid to burnish Bannon’s anti-establishment legacy. “Siege” begins in February 2018, and takes us up to the delivery of the Mueller report this past March. Leaked information about the book has homed in on Wolff’s claim that the Mueller team, back in March 2018, drafted a proposed indictment of the president — an assertion that a spokesman for the special counsel has already denied. For anyone eager to relive the last year, Wolff tracks the scandals (or the major ones, at least — who can count?) in all their bewildering abasement. A sampler: There’s Stormy Daniels’s lawsuit. There’s Trump’s insistence that he could, if he needed to, pardon himself. There’s Melania’s mysterious hospitalization (Wolff doesn’t seem to know why she was hospitalized either). There’s the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, and Jared Kushner “in an off-the-record conversation with a reporter” trying to defend the Saudis by disparaging Khashoggi as a “terrorist.” Kushner comes across in this account as perhaps the saddest figure of all: a hapless schemer. Wolff says that Kushner failed to pass the normal security clearances, and was granted a reprieve only when Trump intervened (calling this assertion “a fact baldly denied by Kushner and his wife”). The Kushner family’s byzantine real estate troubles were, Wolff says, mysteriously solved once a Toronto-based investment firm that worked with a number of sovereign wealth funds stepped in to bail Kushner out. Wolff has Kushner petitioning Henry Kissinger for his advice on international affairs, even floating the suggestion of Kissinger as Trump’s secretary of state soon after the 2016 election; at the time, Kissinger was already 94 years old. Wolff says that Kushner represents “liberal globalism,” though he doesn’t offer much to back it up, instead repeating Bannon’s pet theory that Kushner’s behavior shows how glaringly hypocritical the “true and deeply self-interested face of liberal globalism” actually was. Against this, Bannon positions his own “party of the peasants,” with their “peasant honesty, peasant wisdom and peasant loyalty,” prompting Wolff to make what is either a deeply ironic or inadvertently hilarious comparison of Bannon to Tolstoy. The political analysis in this book is close to nil, but that’s by design. “The heart of this book,” Wolff says, is the experience of the Trump presidency: “an emotional state rather than a political state.” Policies, decision-making, anything that requires even a minimal amount of attention to detail — that happens, as much as possible, without Trump, Wolff says. The president’s staff sees it as their job to keep him in his “bubble,” munching candy bars at night and getting his ego stroked in marathon phone calls with the Fox News host Sean Hannity. On good days, Wolff writes, the president arrives late to the office and is whisked through a series of staged, anodyne meetings to keep him busy: “A distracted Trump was a happy Trump.” Bannon, meanwhile, even having left the White House in 2017, clearly maintains some connections to it, gleefully watching the chaos from the sidelines and appearing before the special counsel five times — or possibly eight, Wolff says, according to some whispers from “Bannon enemies.” Bannon seems comfortable expressing contempt for pretty much everyone — not least the president he helped elect into office. (Though Bannon does declare a measure of respect for Vladimir V. Putin — “a badass” — and, in what might be the most truly shocking turn in the book, Nancy Pelosi, for disinviting Trump from delivering the State of the Union in January and thereby insulting him in the language he most viscerally understands: humiliation. “She crushed this [expletive],” Bannon marvels.) “Siege” reads like a 300-page taunt of the president — from Wolff or from Bannon, though they seem to have arrived at the kind of collaboration in which the distinction doesn’t really matter. In the afterword to the paperback edition of “Fire and Fury,” Wolff bragged about how he “did an end run around the system, catching the journalism apparatus as well as the White House unawares,” deriding the “journalism bureaucracy” for putting so much stock in such niceties as confidentiality and integrity. So now Wolff gets another probable best seller, and Bannon, who boasts about communicating with Trump through the media, gets to show the president who’s really boss. “Bannon believed he was the man of populist destiny and not Donald Trump,” Wolff writes, with Bannon even entertaining the idea of being a presidential contender in 2020. Bannon might wax sentimental about the country’s white working class — whom he lovingly calls “deplorables” — but he treats them as endlessly credulous, riling them up with stories about immigrant caravans and the boons of a trade war while offering them nothing more concrete than the fireworks display of watching the establishment burn. Wolff describes Bannon staying in a $4,500-a-night hotel suite in London — not quite the typical peasant digs, but Bannon thinks like one of the hedge-fund guys he rails against. By the same token, Trump’s misfortune might well turn out to be Bannon’s opportunity. As Bannon tells Wolff, in a rambling, five-page monologue: “I’ll cover myself on the downside.”"

Good morning, We’re covering the fate of China’s access to Wall Street, a shocking stabbing in Japan and budding tea growers in Nepal. Next week is the 30th anniversary of the June 4 crackdown in Tiananmen Square, when soldiers shot into crowds of protesters who were demanding a more open government. Jiang Lin — back then a lieutenant in the People’s Liberation Army and a military journalist who had a firsthand view of the decision-making behind closed doors — broke her silence in an interview with The Times in Beijing. She has since left China. Details: She tells of being in the square as soldiers attacked, being injured and watching the wounded and the dead pour into the hospital. Her account sheds new light on how senior generals and military commanders tried to resist orders to use armed force, signing letters officially pushing back against martial law. One checked himself into a hospital. Quotable: “How could fate suddenly turn so that you could use tanks and machine guns against ordinary people? To me, it was madness.” Context: Authorities in Beijing still work to erase any traces of the massacre from history, resisting efforts to acknowledge that it was wrong and imprisoning former protest leaders and even parents of students and residents who were killed. Trade hawks, like the former Trump adviser Stephen Bannon, are urging an even greater decoupling of China and U.S. financial markets, especially given the lack of transparency about the ultimate owners of Chinese companies. Adding to a broad rethinking of the relationship, Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant that had a hugely successful initial public offering in New York five years ago, is considering listing in Hong Kong’s stock exchange as well, according to a person familiar with the matter. The Trump administration hasn’t announced any moves yet, but if the trade war intensifies, cutting off Chinese companies from Wall Street would be a potent option that could rattle stock markets on both sides of the Pacific. Context: China and Wall Street have largely been allies. Chinese companies have raised tens of billions of dollars through U.S. financial markets in recent years, and Wall Street banks have earned big fees in advising them on I.P.O.s and acquisitions. A man wielding two large knives stabbed 17 schoolgirls and two adults at a bus stop southwest of Tokyo on Tuesday morning, according to the police. An 11-year-old girl and a 39-year-old man died in the assault, and the attacker fatally stabbed himself. A motive hasn’t been identified yet. Officials at Caritas, the Roman Catholic school in Kawasaki that the children attended, said they had received no prior warning. NHK, the public broadcaster, identified the attacker as Ryuichi Iwasaki, 51. Context: The attack stunned a country where violent crimes are rare and the streets are widely considered safe enough for children as young as 6 to head to school on their own. The assault came three years after the worst mass killing in Japan since World War II in which a man fatally stabbed 19 people at a center for disabled people. As of March, the company worked with roughly 121,000 temporary workers and contractors around the world, compared with 102,000 full-time employees, according to an internal document obtained by The Times. Although they often work side by side with full-timers, Google’s temps are usually employed by outside agencies and make less money, have different benefits and have no paid vacation time in the U.S., according to more than a dozen current and former workers. Response: Google has said it will improve conditions for its temps and contractors. Context: While the reliance on temporary help has generated more controversy inside Google, the practice is common in Silicon Valley. The astronomical growth of food delivery apps in China is flooding the country with takeout containers, utensils and bags. The online takeout business is estimated to have generated 1.6 million tons of packaging waste in 2017, a ninefold increase from two years before. People in China still generate less plastic waste, per capita, than Americans, but researchers estimate that nearly three-quarters of China’s plastic waste ends up in poorly managed landfills or out in the open, where it can easily make its way into the sea. Amazon: MacKenzie Bezos, whose stake in Amazon will be worth about $36 billion once her divorce from the founder Jeff Bezos is finalized in July, promised to give more than half of her fortune to charity. Afghanistan: Attacks on schools by the Taliban and other extremist groups tripled from 2017 to 2018, according to a Unicef report, and the number of children not attending school also increased — yet more signs of the deteriorating security situation in the country. Climate fight: The Trump administration is hardening its position against climate science, eliminating future, worst-case effects of a rapidly warming planet from its climate models. The effort is part of the White House’s broader rollback of environmental regulations and policies. South Korea: Jeju Island, which was the site of a government-led slaughter after World War II, is now inviting visitors to learn firsthand about one of the ugliest chapters in modern Korean history. Africa’s “agripreneurs”: A growing number of young, college-educated entrepreneurs are using apps and technology to increase yields and profits across a continent where most agriculture is still subsistence. Snapshot: Above, workers hand rolling green leaf tea in Nepal. Entrepreneurial farmers and factory owners  are developing remarkable loose-leaf teas that are a fraction of the price of tea from across the border in India’s famous tea-growing hub, Darjeeling. College costs: In the U.S., student debt has reached $1.5 trillion, but in many parts of the world recent graduates are debt free. We asked people from dozens of countries to explain how they paid for college. 52 Places traveler: In his latest dispatch, our columnist seeks out the old-school spots in Aalborg, Denmark’s fourth-largest city, which has replaced faded factories with a high-design waterfront.

Banana specialists from around the world are arriving in Miami this week for the eighth International Banana Congress. A primary discussion point is Panama disease, a fungus that rots bananas from the inside. It’s been spreading for decades across Africa, Asia, the Middle East and Australia, threatening one of the world’s most valuable fruit crops. Growers have tried containing it, mostly to no avail. Part of the problem is that cultivated bananas are a single variety — the Cavendish, which replaced the Gros Michel, a monoculture destroyed by a related fungus in the 1950s. Biodiversity would offer disease resistance. But industry supply chains prefer monocultures, which offer uniform growth patterns, harvest times, shipping resilience and ripening processes. “If the banana industry sticks to a single breed that is susceptible to this incurable disease, they’re going to run into trouble,” Dan Koeppel said, a banana historian who also writes for Wirecutter, a product review website owned by The New York Times.

A trade war. Geopolitical turmoil. Heading into 2019, Wall Street analysts had good reason to worry about the impact of international markets on corporate America’s profits. So far, it appears they weren’t worried enough. A wide divide has developed in the performance between the companies with the most exposure to the rest of the world and those that are mostly focused on the United States. At companies in the S&P 500 that draw more than half their revenue from abroad, first-quarter profits fell about 12 percent, according to data from John Butters, the senior earnings analyst at FactSet. By contrast, earnings at firms that generate most of their sales within the United States grew about 6 percent. These diverging fortunes are a reflection of the global economy. After months of hand-wringing about an imminent recession late last year, the United States economy proved surprisingly resilient through the first three months of 2019, expanding at a 3.2 percent clip. Overseas, though, the economic picture was more gloomy. A slowdown in China, exacerbated by rising trade tensions with the United States, has reverberated around the world. Germany, Europe’s largest economy and one that is increasingly reliant on trade with China, has teetered on the verge of a recession. Britain’s tortured withdrawal from the European Union has weighed on the country’s economy as well as that of broader Europe. The International Monetary Fund earlier this year lowered its forecast for global growth in 2019, citing trade tensions and waning business confidence. Not surprisingly the earnings slide among America’s big multinational firms was most acute among those with the greatest exposure to the global economy and the escalating trade war between Beijing and Washington. Technology firms in the S&P 500 have been at the center of the trade dispute, and profits at those companies decreased about 7 percent during the quarter. Much of that was driven by Apple, which accounted for about 40 percent of that decline. China’s slowdown has hit the iPhone maker particularly hard. China is Apple’s third-largest market and a key area of growth. During the first three months of 2019, Apple’s profit fell 16 percent as sales from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan dropped 22 percent. Earnings at American semiconductor manufacturers, which rely on production networks in China and generate a large portion of their sales there, fell 20 percent during the first quarter. And the profits of energy companies have also suffered, as lower oil prices left earnings from the sector down 27 percent in the first quarter. The split could persist as the Trump administration ratchets up the trade war. Wall Street analysts now expect profits at companies with the most overseas exposure to fall 1.4 percent in 2019, compared with a 6 percent increase for domestically focused companies. At the start of the year, analysts forecast that profits for those two sets of companies would grow 6.9 percent and 8.4 percent. And it is a potential threat to this year’s stock market rally. A rebound in the shares of big technology companies propelled the stock market to record highs this year. But the trade war was long considered the biggest risk to the profits of tech companies and the rally in their shares as well as the broader market. With the tensions between the United States and China escalating this month, the bottom lines of those companies and their shares are likely to remain under pressure."

Now another important area is getting a close look: financial markets. Some trade experts and others urging the Trump administration to keep a hawkish stance are discussing whether the White House should curb China’s access to Wall Street. Chinese companies have raised tens of billions of dollars through American financial markets in recent years. Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s former chief strategist, said there were continuing efforts inside and outside the administration to rethink China’s role in American stock markets, in part because of a lack of transparency about the ultimate owners of Chinese companies. “The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq are breaching their fiduciary responsibility to institutional investors, the pension funds of hardworking Americans,” Mr. Bannon said. “It’s outrageous. All of it should be shut down immediately.” Adding fuel to the discussion, Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant that held a hugely successful initial public offering in New York five years ago, is now considering also listing its shares in the semiautonomous Chinese city of Hong Kong, according to a person familiar with the matter. The person, who asked for anonymity because the discussions were not public, said that geopolitical worries were not the driving force for considering the listing. As the United States ramps up other barriers to trade, the outlook for the financial sector on both sides of the Pacific is starting to change, part of a broader decoupling between the two economies. “There are growing calls on the U.S. side for complete decoupling, which is causing Chinese enterprises to re-evaluate their reliance not just on U.S. technology but also on other U.S. resources, including financial markets,” said Andy Mok, a senior fellow at the Center for China and Globalization, a leading research group in Beijing. China has long considered Wall Street an ally. In the late 1990s, Beijing appealed to senior financial executives to lobby the Clinton administration to allow it to join the World Trade Organization, the club of nations that sets global trade rules. Senior executives of major firms like Goldman Sachs and the Blackstone Group often meet with top Chinese leaders. They have also acted as go-betweens, counseling Trump administration officials on how the trade war is being received both in China and on Wall Street. Big banks see the fast-growing country as an important source of business, even if they have largely been blocked from competing in China’s tightly controlled financial system. Chinese companies have raised tens of billions of dollars through American financial markets in recent years. Wall Street banks have earned big fees from advising Chinese businesses on initial public offerings and on acquisitions of American businesses and real estate. “China is full of amazing entrepreneurs whom we look forward to welcoming,” said Robert H. McCooey Jr., a senior vice president of listing services at Nasdaq. The Trump administration hasn’t announced any moves to cut off China, and Chinese companies continue to enjoy access to American markets. Just two weeks ago, Luckin Coffee, a Chinese competitor to Starbucks, surged in its trading debut in New York, though its shares have since traded lower. But skepticism is growing among some administration officials and legislators about the presence of Chinese companies on American capital markets and in major stock indexes. In a letter in April, a bipartisan group of senators including Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida, urged the administration to increase disclosure requirements for Chinese companies listed in the United States that pose national security risks or are complicit in human rights abuses. The letter named HikVision, which the Trump administration is considering blocking from purchasing America components over its role in the surveillance and mass detention of Uighurs, a mostly Muslim ethnic minority. HikVision is a component of MSCI stock indexes, and its investors have included UBS, J. P. Morgan, and the public pension funds of teachers in California and New York. “Americans would likely be very troubled, if not outraged, to learn that their retirement and other investment dollars are funding Chinese companies with links to the Chinese government’s security apparatus and malevolent behavior,” the letter read. It’s not clear how much credence such ideas have with the president and his current advisers. But if Washington did act, China has its own way to strike back. Chinese entities, mainly the country’s central bank and sovereign wealth fund, own at least $200 billion in shares in the United States, by one estimate, giving Beijing a possible additional weapon should Chinese leaders decide to sell. China’s economic policymakers are aware of that extreme option, people familiar with the policymaking said. They insisted on anonymity because of the political and diplomatic sensitivity of the issue. Such a move could shake the American stock market, which Mr. Trump considers a barometer of his success. For many years, policymakers, economists and bankers have asked what might happen to the American economy should China suddenly dump much of the $1.3 trillion it holds in United States debt. Selling stocks could be more potent than paring back bonds. Stock markets tend to respond to smaller sums of money than American government bonds do because the market for Treasury bills is simply so big. China is unlikely to dump shares quickly, said Mark Sobel, a former longtime Treasury official who is now the United States chairman of the London-based Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum. Doing so not only would upset the United States but also could mean selling shares at a loss during a temporary dip in prices, which would hurt the investment return on China’s assets. “In my experience, China’s reserve managers have always acted in a professional manner and sought to promote financial stability,” Mr. Sobel wrote in an email. In the past, Chinese government agencies have quietly and gradually sold part of their American stock holdings when they have needed extra dollars to help manage the value of the currency, said Brad Setser, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. Chinese firms that start changing their relationship with American financial markets now face questions over whether their moves are trade related. Shanghai-based Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, a computer chip maker traded mostly in Hong Kong, is shifting the trading of its American depositary shares from the New York Stock Exchange to the far less visible over-the-counter market. S.M.I.C., as it is known, attributed the decision to low trading volume in its shares in New York. “S.M.I.C. has been considering this migration for a long time, and it has nothing to do with the trade war” or with the trans-Pacific dispute over Huawei, a Chinese tech company, S.M.I.C. said in a statement in response to questions. “The migration requires a long preparation, and timing has coincided with the current trade rhetoric, which may lead to misconceptions.” Alibaba has long discussed selling its shares in mainland China or Hong Kong, so it is not clear what role, if any, the trade war had in its considerations. Jack Ma, the co-founder of Alibaba, had said at a conference in January last year that he would consider whether to do another stock listing in Hong Kong. For Alibaba, a Hong Kong share sale could allow more Chinese investors to put their money in a company that many of them use in their daily lives. Alibaba’s stepped-up discussions over listing in Hong Kong were reported earlier by Bloomberg. With the trade war going on, Mr. Mok, at the Beijing research group, said Chinese companies were now more likely to think twice about depending on American financial markets. “There is no desire on the Chinese side for decoupling,” he said, “but it is maybe a prudent management decision to reduce risk exposure.”"

Ask what you can do for your country.… [+2466 chars]",the-new-york-times,The New York Times,"The Trump administration has been trying out a fresh line with the American public of late: Patriotism requires sacrifice. As the president’s trade wars drag on, putting the economic bite on a growing number of Americans, his team is scrambling to put a nationalist gloss on his protectionist gamble, spinning it as a noble crusade in which the individual interest must be subordinated to the greater good. Sure Americans “pay a little bit,” Mr. Trump acknowledged in a speech to real estate professionals in mid-May. “But it’s worth it.” Concerned about losing support among rural voters caught in the tariff crossfire, he recently issued a Twitter proclamation that America’s “Patriot Farmers” would eventually be “the biggest beneficiaries of what is happening now.” Until then, he plans to subsidize impacted producers. Last Thursday, the Agriculture Department announced that it would provide up to $16 billion in farm aid, to be financed, the president has said, using the “massive Tariffs being paid to the United States for allowing China, and others, to do business with us.”  Mr. Trump failed to mention who pays those “massive Tariffs.” (Hint: Americans.) But he has never been one to let details get in the way of a good plotline. The president’s chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, has been more frank about the United States-China showdown. “Both sides will suffer,” he said after trade talks with China broke down earlier this month. But the “possible improvement in trade and exports and open markets” make the suffering “worthwhile,” he added. “You’ve got to do what you got to do.” Republican lawmakers, usually a free-trade-loving bunch, have taken up the cause as well. Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania allowed that tariffs are “absolutely painful and dislocating,” but he reasoned that, someday, Americans might look back and say they were “worth the price.” And when it comes to wrapping tariffs in the flag, no one can touch Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas. Yes, the trade war will require “some sacrifices on the part of Americans,” he said, but the costs “will be pretty minimal” compared with those paid by American troops serving overseas and our “fallen heroes.” Give Mr. Cotton debate points: Few would dispute that being killed in action is more of a hardship than paying a little extra for spark plugs or baseball mitts or live eels.  Fewer still would make such a tasteless comparison. Previous presidents have appealed to Americans’ patriotism in wartime. In peacetime, President Kennedy’s 1961 inaugural entreaty — “Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country.” — inspired an entire generation. The Trumpian call to duty, however, is a particularly bold — even counterintuitive — choice for a president whose core message has always been that he can save anxious Americans from having to make tough choices, to adapt to economic changes or to face scary cultural shifts. His pledge to Make America Great Again has never been about helping move the nation into the future, but about easing it back into a more comforting past. In his capacity as Strong Leader, he has vowed to take care of everything, and it is all going to be “so easy.” There is, in fact, no problem so big or so complex that Mr. Trump has not boasted of his ability to fix it quickly and painlessly. Repealing and replacing Obamacare with a better, cheaper system? Easy. Returning domestic manufacturing to its heyday? Easy. Lowering gas prices? Ending the drug problem? Dealing with China? Easy, easy and easy. Restoring cultural and economic security by erecting a big, beautiful border wall that Mexico will pay for? Piece. Of. Cake. Of all Mr. Trump’s grandiose claims, his pledge to restore lost manufacturing jobs remains among the most heartbreaking. “Don’t move. Don’t sell your houses,” he soothed voters in the Rust Belt town of Youngstown, Ohio, in 2017. “They’re all coming back,” he promised of the jobs and prosperity. These dreams have not come to pass. Mr. Trump’s rosy reassurances that trade wars “are good, and easy to win” have proved equally hollow. Farmers are not the only ones suffering. Manufacturers are paying higher prices. The instability is disrupting markets. Small wonder the latest Quinnipiac poll shows only 39 percent of Americans approve of the president’s trade policies. It’s always possible that the president will confound the naysayers and emerge from what he has called his “little squabble with China” with some big-picture successes. Alternatively, this folly could wind up wreaking global havoc well beyond the economic sphere.  Either way, Team Trump recognizes the immediate political potential of its new messaging. The president’s gift for waging culture war has served him well in keeping his fans riled up and his critics off-kilter. By turning trade into a matter of national pride — a clash of civilizations, if you will — he’s reminding supporters that he is fighting for them against both foreign competitors and “globalists” here at home. This can help distract from whatever economic pain they’re experiencing. At least for now. In the meantime, Mr. Trump has no intention of abandoning his penchant for making impossible promises. At a rally in Montoursville, Pa., last week, he went on and on about how he had saved American industry, saying, “Remember the old days, we actually made our own product.” The president lamented the tens of thousands of factories that have been shuttered post-Nafta, before proclaiming triumphantly, “They’re all coming back!” Are they, Mr. President?

Tariffs don’t observe long weekends, but at least markets around the world will get a break from their two-week slump for Memorial Day and a bank holiday in Britain. Here’s what else you need to know in business and tech news. MAY 19-25 Remember the good old days when a trade deal with China seemed right around the corner? Alas. Global markets took an ungraceful dive as talks between Beijing and Washington stopped entirely. Plus we saw how the dispute can have real-world damage. A report shows that the tariff war will cost the average American household an extra $831 a year. Particularly hard hit are farmers who depended on China to buy crops like soybeans and peanuts. But they won’t be left out in the cold, especially since they’re an important part of President Trump’s voter base. On Thursday, the Agriculture Department announced a $16 billion farmers’ aid package to tide them over — on top of the $12 billion it doled out for the same reason last year.  A Chicago banker was charged on Thursday with lending $16 million to Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s now-disgraced former campaign chairman, to secure a top post in the administration in 2016. At the time, Mr. Manafort was facing foreclosure on several properties and getting desperate for money. Stephen M. Calk, chairman of the Federal Savings Bank, bailed him out and sent him a list of positions he’d accept in return, including Army secretary. Mr. Manafort did get Mr. Calk an interview, but soon had bigger problems than debt repayments (and presumably can no longer call in favors from jail). Mr. Calk never got that offer, and could serve up to 30 years in prison for bribery instead.  Baltimore remains locked in a standoff with hackers who took over a bunch of the city’s computer systems more than two weeks ago. In exchange for their digital hostages, the hackers are demanding three Bitcoins (more than $24,000) per system or 13 Bitcoins (about $105,000) for them all. Mayor Bernard Young has said he won’t cooperate, but acknowledged last week that he may have to reconsider if the situation drags on. For now, city officials are stuck without voice mail, email and a system used to pay water bills, property taxes and vehicle citations. (On the bright side, no parking tickets!) Baltimore is one of several American cities that have recently been attacked using technology that was originally developed by the National Security Agency and stolen in 2017. may 26-JUNE 1 Mr. Trump will be in Japan until Tuesday to hobnob with Emperor Naruhito, who took the throne on May 1, and attend a sumo wrestling match. He will also meet with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (or Abe Shinzo, as we should really call him) and may chat about everyone’s favorite subject: trade. Japan’s economy — the third largest in the world, behind you know who — is performing quite nicely these days, a pleasant surprise considering that one of its biggest trade partners (yes, you know who again) is not faring so well.  Always wanted to grab some steaks and Cherry Cokes with Warren Buffett? Here’s your chance: The annual auction for a “power lunch” with the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway is open for bidding through this Friday. Last year’s meal cost the winner $3,300,100 — a relative steal compared with the record bid of $3,456,789 in 2016. Proceeds from the auction will benefit a San Francisco homeless charity.  The singer-slash-designer Rihanna has officially released her inaugural collection for Fenty, the first major fashion label headed by a woman of color (and the first new label in decades from French luxury goods powerhouse LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, which traditionally sticks to heritage brands). Should you be interested in procuring a structured corset dress with puffy sleeves, the clothes will go on sale this Thursday. And while its prices aren’t exactly accessible (a T-shirt will run you about $200, while a jacket is more like $1,500), the items come in larger sizes than most high-end brands — a nod to a different kind of inclusivity.  Theresa May announced that she would step down as Britain’s prime minister after months of failed attempts to get her Brexit plan through Parliament. In other news, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and the French carmaker Renault are said to be holding discussions about a possible alliance. And Amazon is creating a bracelet-style device that can reportedly read emotions by the sound of its wearer’s voice — and even offer guidance for managing those feelings. "

Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here. Hi, I’m Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. Here’s a look at the week’s tech news: President Trump’s latest swipe at Huawei could be the start of a deep transformation of the tech sector. Citing national security concerns, the Commerce Department said this month that American companies would need special permission to sell some products to Huawei and other Chinese companies. This past week, things escalated. Companies including Google, Qualcomm and Broadcom froze some of the supply of products to the Chinese technology giant. (Google, for instance, will no longer offer Huawei the full version of its Android operating system.) The crackdown may expand, with a ban on sales to Chinese surveillance companies possible. Third-country suppliers also need a license to sell products to Huawei if content from the United States contributes more than 25 percent to their value, and the British semiconductor designer ARM said it would stop licensing technology to Huawei’s chip unit. (Mobile carriers in Britain also stopped offering Huawei phones to some customers, over Android support concerns.) What now? The United States government offered a 90-day grace period for some transactions between American companies and Huawei. That “doesn’t mean much,” Ren Zhengfei, Huawei’s founder, said, but it could signal that the overarching ban is little more than short-lived trade posturing. Still, the Trump administration has spoken repeatedly about its desire to blunt China’s technological development, and China threatened to retaliate. So this could be the start of a long fight — the raising of “a digital Iron Curtain,” as my colleague Li Yuan put it. “This is a turning point,” said Xiaolan Fu, the director of the Technology and Management Center for Development at Oxford University. “It is changing the direction to a more closed, protectionist approach.” If the freeze-out persists, the near term looks rough for Huawei’s smartphone division. It has stockpiled Western chips, maintained supply from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (the world’s largest contract chip maker) and developed its own phone software. But it could be crippled by an inability to source components and may struggle to find markets outside China for its devices. In the long term, the ban could push the world toward divided technologies. “The lesson the Chinese have taken from the Trump administration’s trade strategy is that the U.S. is pursuing a technology containment approach,” said Adam Segal, the director of the digital and cyberspace policy program at the Council on Foreign Relations. The solution is independence — something China has pushed for by encouraging domestic tech prowess, including in chip production. “I think we are moving toward a bifurcated technology system,” Mr. Segal said. China uses Chinese products, and America uses American products. A big question then: Which side do other countries take? The United States probably assumes the West will follow its lead. But nations like Britain and Germany aren’t yielding to American pressure to block Huawei from building next-generation 5G wireless networks over national security risks. Poorer countries are likely to be won over by price: Huawei is one of the leading, and cheapest, developers of 5G technology. For some countries wanting to jump-start economies with fast wireless networks, siding with China may be the only option. Such fragmentation may affect consumers. Ms. Fu points out that in a globalized economy, manufacturing takes place in the most efficient location. A move to protectionism would prompt China and the United States to relocate production domestically, or at least to ally nations, which could drive up prices of devices. And the development and deployment of 5G in a fragmented environment could lack economies of scale afforded by globalism, Mr. Segal said. That could potentially delay its rollout and increase cost. Welcome to tech’s Cold War. Geopolitics isn’t the only force of change in the smartphone industry: So is the tech industry’s new obsession, antitrust. On Tuesday, Judge Lucy Koh of United States District Court in San Jose, Calif., ruled that Qualcomm had suppressed competition in the smartphone chip market and charged “onerous” fees for the use of its patents. “Qualcomm’s licensing practices have strangled competition,” she wrote. It must now strike new licensing agreements and be monitored for seven years to ensure compliance. Phone makers, particularly Apple, had bristled at Qualcomm’s royalties, which could be as high as 5 percent of a handset’s wholesale price. (Apple turned the other cheek and settled its royalty case with Qualcomm last month, sacrificing $27 billion in damages and making a payment of at least $4.5 billion to use Qualcomm’s 5G chips.) So the ruling could reduce costs for smartphone makers and consumers. It also undercuts Qualcomm’s business model, which is largely based on profits from patent fees. It could also complicate efforts by the United States to assert itself in the creation of 5G networks. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development announced a set of principles on Wednesday to guide the development of artificial intelligence. Conspicuous by its presence on the list of nations backing the rules: the United States. The Trump administration long shied away from such policies. But as my colleague Steve Lohr reported in April, it was spurred into action by a wave of tech regulation — particularly Europe’s new General Data Protection Regulation. The realization: Regulations that would affect the nation’s tech industry were coming, and federal officials needed to participate if they were to shape them. So the administration decided to collaborate with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and this is the first time that it has formally endorsed a set of international A.I. guidelines. The guidelines — which suggest that A.I. should benefit people and the planet, and be designed to respect the rule of law and human rights, among other things — aren’t legally binding. But Jack Clark, the head of policy at OpenAI, an artificial intelligence lab in San Francisco, said it was “quite significant” that the United States had signed on to them. It is, he said, a sign that the administration is “putting its weight behind” the development of A.I. ■ Big Tech seized the protectionist narrative. Executives have suggested that strict regulation of their companies could hand advantages to the Chinese. ■ Cleaning up Facebook brings its A.I. whiz to tears. When its chief technology officer discussed the complexity of using artificial intelligence to cure toxic content problems, he welled up. ■ Tech jobs have the potential to propel people into the middle class. But so far, such results have been few and far between. ■ Google Glass still exists. The latest incarnation of the smart spectacles, heavily upgraded and priced at $999, is still firmly aimed at workplace users. ■ There’s bipartisan support for facial recognition regulation.

President Trump yesterday unveiled a $16 billion bailout for farmers hurt by his trade war with Beijing. That signals a protracted fight lies ahead, Ana Swanson of the NYT writes. • “The new program will make $14.5 billion in direct payments to producers, for a range of products — from soybeans and cotton to chickpeas and cherries — in up to three tranches, beginning in late July or early August.” • “The government will also put in place a $1.4 billion program to purchase surplus commodities affected by the trade war.” Any hope of a quick resolution has faded. The U.S. and China have both hardened their positions after a trade deal collapsed this month. “Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday that no additional meetings with Beijing were scheduled and that he was encouraging American firms to reorient their supply chains and source their products elsewhere,” Ms. Swanson notes. “I remain hopeful that at some point we’ll get together with China,” Mr. Trump said yesterday. “If it happens, great. If it doesn’t happen, that’s fine. That’s absolutely fine.” Global markets tumbled as investors realized that the farmer payouts were a sign that Mr. Trump’s trade war is here to stay. Benchmark indexes in China, Germany and France all dropped, while the S&P 500 fell 1.2 percent. More: The Trump administration plans to penalize countries that undervalue their currencies. Tariffs could cost the average U.S. household $831 a year. And a look at how America’s chief trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, has a track record of all-or-nothing negotiations.  Theresa May announced this morning that she would step down as Britain’s prime minister, Stephen Castle of the NYT writes. • She will resign as party leader on June 7, but stay on as prime minister until a successor is chosen. • Her departure comes after she repeatedly failed to win Parliament’s approval for a deal to withdraw Britain from the European Union. • “I have done everything I can,” Mrs. May said. But she added that it was in the “best interests of the country for a new prime minister” to lead Britain through the Brexit process. • The breaking point comes at an awkward moment, with President Trump scheduled to arrive in Britain on June 3 for a state visit. The announcement “could set off a ferocious succession contest within her governing Conservative Party,” Mr. Castle writes. The former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson; the former Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab; and Andrea Leadsom, who had quit as leader of the House of Commons on Wednesday, are all seen as likely contenders. It leaves Britain’s future more uncertain than ever, with no clearly favorable route out of the E.U., nor any obvious plan to stay in the bloc either. Mrs. May’s successor has a tough task ahead. President Trump issued contradictory messages about the Chinese technology giant yesterday, calling Huawei a “very dangerous” security threat — but also hinting that it could be part of a trade deal with China. Here’s what he said: “Huawei is something that’s very dangerous. You look at what they’ve done from a security standpoint, from a military standpoint, it’s very dangerous. So it’s possible that Huawei even would be included in some kind of a trade deal. If we made a deal, I could imagine Huawei being possibly included in some form, some part of a trade deal.” He offered no specifics of what that might look like. When pushed for details, Mr. Trump responded: “Oh it’s too early to say. We’re just very concerned about Huawei from a security standpoint.” Huawei is hurting because U.S. companies are blocked from selling products to it. It has received a 90-day grace period for some of those sales,which has been viewed by some people as a sign that the freeze-out is only short-lived trade posturing. Sound familiar? Last year, Mr. Trump banned the sale of U.S. parts to the Chinese technology company ZTE after it violated sanctions on Iran and North Korea. It was given a 90-day reprieve, and the ban was subsequently lifted. But this time could be different. Mr. Trump’s contradictory comments may cause confusion, but if U.S. authorities stick by their assessment of the risks posed by Huawei then the predictions that this is the start of tech’s Cold War still appear likely to hold true. More: Huawei’s European customers are being hit particularly hard by the Trump ban. One of its executives has been accused of stealing trade secrets. And Amazon Japan has stopped selling Huawei devices. The disgraced former movie executive has tentatively agreed to pay $44 million to settle lawsuits by New York’s attorney general and women who have accused him of sexual misconduct. Here are the terms of the proposed deal, according to the NYT, citing unnamed sources: • About $30 million would go to a pool of plaintiffs that includes alleged victims, creditors of Mr. Weinstein’s former studio and some former employees. • The balance would cover legal fees for associates of Mr. Weinstein, including board members named as defendants in the lawsuits. • Insurance policies would cover the $44 million if the current agreement is finalized. The proposed sum is less than half what had been previously discussed. Last year, conversations between an investor group interested in buying parts of the Weinstein Company and the New York attorney general at the time, Eric Schneiderman, included a victim’s fund worth up to $90 million. But those talks collapsed at the last minute. The outcome will be important because lawsuits are one of the few ways to hold Mr. Weinstein accountable, the NYT notes. Though he faces criminal charges in Manhattan — which he has pleaded not guilty to — the vast majority of complaints against him involve sexual harassment, which is a civil violation. The WikiLeaks leader has been indicted in the United States on 17 counts of violating the Espionage Act. It’s a novel case — and one that raises profound First Amendment issues, Charlie Savage of the NYT reports. The case centers on the leaking of documents, in particular Mr. Assange’s role in the release of hundreds of thousands of government files by Chelsea Manning, a former Army intelligence officer. It has nothing to do with Russia’s interference in the 2016 U.S. elections. The indictment could amount to the pursuit of a publisher for making that material available to the public, Michael Grynbaum and Marc Tracy of the NYT write. This would go beyond the targets of previous cases like this: government employees who provided material to journalists. Justice Department officials tried to minimize the precedent. They said most of the charges are related to obtaining the classified information, not publishing it. And the few charges that are tied to publication of the documents focused on issues like revealing the names of informants in war zones. But supporters of journalistic freedoms are rattled. “If you can charge Julian Assange under the law with publishing classified information, there is nothing under the law that prevents the Justice Department from charging a journalist,” Matthew Miller, a former Justice Department spokesman in the Obama administration, told the NYT. Paychecks may be improving thanks to a strong job market, but a new Fed survey shows that many Americans are still struggling with their personal finances, Jeanna Smialek of the NYT writes. • “Four in 10 American adults wouldn’t be able to cover an unexpected $400 expense with cash, savings or a credit-card charge that could be quickly paid off.” • “About 27 percent of people surveyed would need to borrow or sell something to pay for such a bill, and 12 percent would not be able to cover it at all.” • “One-quarter of working individuals say they have no retirement savings at all,” the WSJ notes. • “Roughly a quarter of adults skipped medical care in 2018 because they were unable to pay,” it adds. “Many Americans remain on the edge financially even as this economic expansion is approaching record length and people have become more optimistic,” Ms. Smialek writes. But it’s not all bad news. For an unexpected $400 expense, “the share that could cover such an expense more easily has been climbing steadily and now stands at 61 percent, up from just half when the Fed started this annual survey in 2013,” Ms. Smialek writes. “Household finances over all have shown a marked improvement over the life of this report, thanks in large part to an improving labor market that has lifted wages and left more Americans with jobs. Three-quarters of adults said they were ‘doing O.K.’ or ‘living comfortably’ when asked about their economic well-being, up from 63 percent in 2013.” More: The cover story of this week’s Economist explains that rich countries are enjoying “an unprecedented jobs boom.” For more than two decades, David Tepper has been one of the most celebrated and successful hedge fund managers. Now he plans to leave the industry, in part to focus on other passions like running the N.F.L.’s Carolina Panthers. His firm, Appaloosa, could return outside clients’ money. Executives there have reportedly discussed several ways that could happen, Juliet Chung of the WSJ reports, citing unnamed sources. More than 70 percent of the money currently managed by the $13 billion hedge fund is his. That would make Appaloosa a family office, freed from the burdens associated with managing other people’s cash — and the requirement of disclosing his firm’s investment returns to outsiders. Next up for Mr. Tepper: football. He bought the Panthers last year for a record $2.2 billion and wants to focus on turning the team around, Ms. Chung reports. He’s also reportedly interested in bringing a Major League Soccer team to the stadium where the Panthers play.

But the party’s disregard for the economic interests of its own constituents goes well beyond barriers to Chinese markets. Small towns and rural areas, along with some Rust Belt metros, are falling ever further behind booming urban dynamos — leaving many heavily Republican regions in a deepening morass of economic deterioration, joblessness, substance abuse and declining life expectancy. The lower-density places most Republicans call home produce barely half as much wealth as our biggest cities — and it’s showing.  Yet the travails of America’s struggling red regions, and practical ideas about might be done to alleviate them, are barely mentioned in right-leaning policy circles. For example, “The Once and Future Worker,” a widely discussed book by Oren Cass, a former economic policy adviser to Mitt Romney now at the Manhattan Institute, focuses on initiatives to expand employment and wages for American workers but largely neglects the changing geography of economic output and opportunity behind the woes of heartland workers. Worse, the Republican Party under Mr. Trump has blundered into a positively anti-rural economic agenda, leaving the soybean fields littered with $20 bills for enterprising Democratic presidential hopefuls to pick up. The president’s nativist immigration agenda deprives farms and small factories of workers local economies can’t otherwise supply, while the administration’s latest budget proposal continues the Republican assault on the health care and social insurance programs rural populations increasingly rely on to survive. To address the problem, we need to understand it. For decades, poorer areas had been converging economically with wealthier ones, but that stalled in the early 1980s as employment began to shift away from widely distributed agriculture and manufacturing jobs toward the service sector and high-skill “knowledge work” in the city-centered information economy. Since then, inequalities in regional productivity and living standards have been widening. The declining capacity of smaller towns and cities to bounce back from job loss — whether because of recession, automation or offshoring — means that the regional economic gap grows wider with every downturn, “disruptive” technological advance or uptick in global economic integration. As smaller towns lost population and viability as centers of commerce, the families of workers who remained in rural hamlets came to rely on trips to larger nearby towns and cities for their shopping, education and health care. But then many of the factories supporting these regional hubs downsized, moved overseas or folded under competition from countries with cheaper labor. Assembly-line workers who lost jobs mostly shifted to lower-paid service jobs or dropped out of the work force. Crucially, the college-educated workers who ran these factories — the engineers, managers and lawyers — began to flee with their families to the opportunities in bigger cities, and took their money, civic energy and organizational know-how with them.  Some of these rural hubs are hanging on — thanks to immigration. The population of Marshalltown, Iowa, my childhood hometown, has remained steady for decades — but it is now nearly 30 percent Hispanic. This has sustained the largest employer, a meatpacking plant, and many auxiliary local businesses. However, this infusion of lower-skill immigrant labor means that Marshall County’s average household income is now lower in real terms than it was in 1978, when my family moved there.  Scholars at the Brookings Institution’s Hamilton Project have devised a county-level “Vitality Index” combining weighted measures of median household income, poverty, life expectancy, housing vacancy and rates of unemployment and prime-age employment from 1980 to 2016. They find that the fifth of the American population living in counties with the highest share of rural population suffer the lowest levels of vitality — by a long shot. Americans in these low-vitality counties are far more likely to live in poverty, suffer health problems, die early and lack a job. These places, it bears emphasizing, are overwhelmingly majority Republican. So what can be done? Here are five ideas:  States with flagging economies and declining populations lack the tax base to finance the programs needed to maintain healthy economies. We should adopt fiscal measures to “equalize,” or share, national wealth, which are standard in other advanced countries. This would help prop-up state budgets and ensure the healthy functioning of our decentralized federal system. Basic scientific research and infrastructure investments pay big, long-term economic dividends, yet they are underfunded. A network of federally chartered regional development banks could support weak local economies by issuing tax-favored bonds to finance infrastructure upgrades and promising Research and Development projects spearheaded by currently struggling state universities. The Small Business Administration could be refitted to expand small firms that generate growth in exports and high-value-added sectors, as the economist Dani Rodrik has suggested, rather than simply supplying cheap credit to mom-and-pop shops that sustain, but don’t expand, local employment. A new federal Office for Struggling Regions could facilitate interstate compacts and agreements to help attract firms to flagging local economies on terms that prevent the race-to-the-bottom tax-incentive bidding wars. Granting states some authority to mint visas to meet their specific labor market needs would help dry up demand for undocumented workers, stave off depopulation, keep businesses in place, and fill in fiscal gaps. Creative ideas like these have been notably absent in right-leaning policy circles. Conservatives who have come to embrace economic nationalism have misdiagnosed the problem, and therefore fail to see why bullying trade partners and indiscriminately cracking down on immigration won’t bring back jobs and increase wages. Worthwhile ideas, such as Oren Cass’s wage subsidy proposal, have limited potential outside a larger vision of restoring the economic health of struggling regions. We can’t subsidize wages if workers can’t find jobs. On the left, the picture is brighter. The Brookings Institution has taken the lead in analyzing regional inequality and outlining an agenda to address it. But the reality of widening geographic disparities has been slow to penetrate Democratic politics and policymaking. Elizabeth Warren’s plan to protect family farms and check the market power of agribusiness giants takes rural woes seriously, but it’s a band-aid on a hemorrhage. Politically, if Mr. Trump once again chooses divisive culture-war theatrics over an honest attempt to shore up the places that, for now, still prefer Republicans — probably a good bet — Democrats could flip rural House and Senate seats Republicans have long considered “safe.” This mere possibility could even become likely if only Democratic primary contenders, now seeking favor in rural states, would finally spot the glittering opportunity that Republican misrule has laid at their feet.

But Senate Democrats, with the backing of their counterparts … [+1834 chars]",the-new-york-times,The New York Times,"WASHINGTON — The Senate on Thursday passed a long-delayed disaster relief package, a step toward ending a monthslong impasse that had prevented the release of billions of dollars in aid for farmers and communities struggling to recover from an onslaught of natural disasters over the last two years. Minutes after a tornado warning blared through the Capitol chambers, the Senate voted 85 to 8 to allocate $19.1 billion for recovery efforts across the country. While the package included $900 million for Puerto Rico that President Trump had objected to, it did not include funds for the southwestern border that the White House had pressed for. “We took it all out. We’re going to try to push that separately when we come back,” Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama and the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, told reporters, referring to the administration’s request for additional aid for the border. “It’s a good deal. This disaster issue has played on for months and months.” Although most representatives have left Washington for a weeklong Memorial Day recess, House leaders hope to pass the emergency spending bill as soon as Friday using unanimous consent. But some House Republicans are likely to be discontent with the measure, and any lawmaker could block the motion and delay final passage until the full chamber returns. Still, the Senate vote was significant progress after months of partisan debate that has stymied recovery efforts across the country. The deal came together after Mr. Shelby and Senator David Perdue, Republican of Georgia secured a commitment from Mr. Trump during a midafternoon phone call. The president said he would support the aid bill, despite the money for Puerto Rico and the absence of any funds to help feed and care for migrants detained at the southwestern border. “We said we’ve got a window of opportunity here where we have an agreement in principle,” Mr. Perdue said. “We went through the pluses and minuses, and he said, ‘Well, look, we’ve got to get this done.’” The president seized on the bill’s passage through the Senate as a victory. “The U.S. Senate has just approved a 19 Billion Dollar Disaster Relief Bill, with my total approval,” he said on Twitter. “Great!” Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah and one of eight Republican who voted against the measure, said in a statement that he objected to “rushing through billion-dollar spending bills at the 11th hour without sufficient debate.” (Seven senators did not vote.) “It’s unfortunate that today’s spending bill, which was initially aimed at aiding Americans affected by natural disasters, has been loaded up with billions of dollars in unrelated pet projects,” he said. The bill includes an extension of the National Flood Insurance Program and more than $3 billion to rebuild military bases and Coast Guard facilities. It also provides $2.4 billion for community development block grants in Puerto Rico and states, and $3.25 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers to repair damaged infrastructure and prepare for future storms, according to the office of Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont. Lawmakers in both chambers had pushed hard to reconcile the disaster aid package with the White House’s border security request before leaving for recess. As of Wednesday night, Mr. McConnell’s aides were pressing for the combination, according to a senior Democratic aide. “I don’t care who takes credit,” Mr. Leahy, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, told reporters after some Republicans credited Mr. Trump for breaking the impasse. “We’re Americans. We came together.” Congress has not passed a broad disaster relief package since February 2018, when lawmakers included nearly $90 billion in aid in a budget deal that reopened the government after a shutdown. In the year since, natural disasters have devastated the country: hurricanes in Florida, Georgia, Alabama and the Carolinas, wildfires in California, and floods across much of the Midwest. “The Senate’s bipartisan vote is a big step toward making law and actually delivering the relief that communities across our nation need,” said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader. He lamented the failure to include border funding for “overwhelmed agencies, agencies which are running on fumes.” Approving emergency relief bills after a natural disaster has typically involved a swift display of bipartisanship, but efforts to reach a compromise this year have been gridlocked. Lawmakers first struggled with Mr. Trump’s aversion to additional assistance for Puerto Rico, as Senate Republicans refused to vote on a bill he did not support. The president’s request for billions of dollars more for the border further complicated the negotiations. In the meantime, Puerto Ricans saw some nutritional assistance expire in March. The first named tropical storm of the year already formed — then dissipated — in the Atlantic Ocean, and hard-hit military bases and communities in coastal states have gone begging. The delay has been particularly hard on farmers, already bruised by the administration’s trade war and reluctant to move forward in the middle of planting season without the promise of federal aid. Senate Democrats, with the backing of their House counterparts, refused to endorse any legislation that did not include substantial money for Puerto Rico’s recovery efforts from two hurricanes in 2017. While the island had received supplemental aid — some of which has yet to be disbursed — Democrats argued that the Trump administration has neglected the island, which does not have voting representation in Congress, warranting even more funds. The president, for his part, has falsely stated that the island has received $91 billion since the 2017 hurricanes. That figure is the Office of Management and Budget’s estimate of how much the island could secure over the next two decades. Amid that scuffle, two disaster relief bills failed in the Senate, and the upper chamber did not take up a House-passed bill that would have sent $19.1 billion in relief across the country. Negotiators also disagreed over Mr. Shelby’s push to include language that would release funds from a harbor maintenance fund, which he ultimately agreed to omit. In recent weeks, demands from the administration and its Republican allies to include funds for the southwestern border became the major sticking point in negotiations, as the administration escalated its efforts to respond to a surge of asylum seekers and undocumented immigrants. Democrats balked at allocating billions of dollars more toward border security without additional supervision into how the money would be spent. Representative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut and a member of the House Appropriations Committee, described the Democrats’ approach as “a good-faith offer, but not a blank check.” Democrats rejected as a nonstarter the administration’s request for more beds at migrant processing centers, though lawmakers said they expected to revisit the issue after their recess. Mr. Schumer, concerned that Republicans would bring up legislation that did not have what he considered adequate aid for Puerto Rico, encouraged his caucus to block any of those measures, according to a person familiar with the exchange. “The money is going to go where it is intended, not to anything else, to a wall or anything else,” Mr. Schumer said. “And the point to make here? Better late than never.” And while the fate of the overall relief package in the House remains uncertain, senators from both parties celebrated the chance to go home with the promise of federal aid to come — and for a pause in the late-night wrangling over negotiations. “Will you boys let me go home?” Mr. Leahy, who is 79, joked with Mr. Perdue and Mr. Scott as they took questions. “I want to go scuba diving.”"

It hasn’t been pleasant. The Philadelphia semiconductor index, the closely watched index of 30 semiconductor companies, has fallen about 16 percent in May, its worst monthly showing since the financial crisis, as the growing dispute takes a toll on companies reliant on China for business. Shares of Qualcomm, Micron, Nvidia and Broadcom are all down by even more. By comparison, the S&P 500 is down about 4 percent. President Trump, emboldened by the strength of the United States economy, has escalated his fight with Beijing in recent weeks. He raised tariffs on Chinese goods and restricted American firms from selling components and technology to Huawei. China, in turn, raised tariffs of its own and has shown no signs of backing down. China accounted for 35 percent of global semiconductor sales, according to Evercore ISI. Huawei, alone, spent $11 billion buying components and other supplies from American companies last year, said Joe Kelly, a Huawei spokesman. But by Monday, after the Trump administration’s blacklisting of Huawei, major American semiconductor makers such as Qualcomm, Intel and Broadcom had started to step back from their dealings with the Chinese company. Even before the latest escalation, the semiconductor makers were feeling the impact of the trade war as well as a slowing global economy. Profits for chip makers in the S&P 500 fell 21 percent during the first quarter, among the worst showings by any industry group within the index, according to FactSet. Over the past year, the performance of semiconductor shares, perhaps more than any other group of stocks, has been tied to the fate of the trade war between the world’s two largest economies. The Philadelphia semiconductor index in October fell 13.7 percent after Mr. Trump ratcheted up his trade fight with Beijing. The index finished the year down nearly 8 percent. But as the trade tensions cooled during the first few months of this year and a deal appeared near, shares of chip makers soared. By late April, the semiconductor index was up 37 percent to a record high, while the S&P 500 had gained about 17 percent. That rally in chip stocks also highlighted a simple reality: While they are likely to continue to be buffeted by the ups and downs of the trade negotiations, semiconductors increasingly power the products and technology that are crucial to our daily lives and future, from the chips in iPhones and the latest-generation cellular networks to self-driving cars and artificial intelligence. For now, though, shares of these companies seem like investors’ favorite trade-war punching bag."

Th… [+1973 chars]",the-new-york-times,The New York Times,"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Thursday unveiled a $16 billion bailout for farmers hurt by his trade war with Beijing, signaling a protracted fight ahead that is already prompting some American companies to shift business away from China. Mr. Trump, flanked by farmers and ranchers in cowboy hats during remarks at the White House, said China had “taken advantage” of the United States for far too long and vowed to protect an industry that has been “used as a vehicle” by Beijing to hurt America’s economy. “Farmers have been attacked by China,” Mr. Trump said, adding that if the United States is in a trade war, “we’re winning it big.” Global markets tumbled on Thursday as investors began coming to terms with the idea that Mr. Trump’s trade war is here to stay. Benchmark indexes in China, Germany and France all dropped, with the S&P 500 falling 1.2 percent. American crude oil prices were down more than 5 percent, amid growing concern that the trade war would start to drag on global economic demand. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.29 percent at 3 p.m., according to Bloomberg data. That was its lowest closing level this year and a sign that investors were expecting lower levels of growth and inflation. Hopes for a quick resolution to the China trade fight have faded, with both countries hardening their positions after a trade deal collapsed this month. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday that no additional meetings with Beijing were scheduled and that he was encouraging American firms to reorient their supply chains and source their products elsewhere. Progress toward a trade agreement between the United States and China collapsed after American negotiators accused Beijing of reneging on terms it had previously committed to. Significant differences remain over how tariffs should be rolled back between the countries, and whether the negotiated provisions must be enshrined in Chinese law. While both sides initially suggested they would continue talking, Beijing has also begun bracing for a long trade fight. In a defiant statement this week, China’s president, Xi Jinping, called for the Chinese people to begin a modern “long march,” invoking a time of hardship from the country’s history, which many China watchers viewed as a hardening of Beijing’s trade stance. “I am growing more and more skeptical that there is a place where the two sides can come to a deal,” said Edward Alden, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. “If I look at the positions the two sides have taken at the moment, I do not see a path to a deal.” Mr. Trump on Thursday once again suggested that he was happy to keep his trade fight going indefinitely. “I remain hopeful that at some point we’ll get together with China,” he said. “If it happens, great. If it doesn’t happen, that’s fine. That’s absolutely fine.” More companies have been pulling back from doing business with Chinese firms, especially multinationals that provided services to Huawei, the telecommunications equipment giant. The Trump administration announced last week that it would blacklist Huawei over national security concerns, prompting Google and mobile carriers to say they would no longer do business with it. The benchmark index of American semiconductor stocks fell 1.7 percent, as investors continued to grapple with the administration’s efforts to restrict sales to Huawei. On Thursday, the president called Huawei “very dangerous” but said it was “possible” that an arrangement involving the company could be included in a China trade deal. “If we made a deal, I can imagine Huawei being included in some form or some part of a trade deal,” he said.  More restrictions on dealing with Chinese tech companies could come soon. The New York Times reported on Tuesday that the Trump administration was considering another ban on American companies supplying components to Hikvision, a Chinese surveillance camera maker that has been criticized for playing a role in the Chinese government’s monitoring and repression of Uighurs, a mostly Muslim ethnic minority. The crackdown on Chinese technology, coupled with Mr. Trump’s decision to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods and begin the process to tax another $300 billion, has exacerbated tensions with Beijing. The Chinese government has accused the United States of bullying China and vowed to further retaliate on American products, particularly agricultural goods. In a note on Wednesday, analysts from Nomura Global Markets Research said their baseline scenario was that Mr. Trump would put a 25 percent tariff on all Chinese exports to the United States by the end of 2019, most likely after he is scheduled to meet with Mr. Xi at the Group of 20 summit meeting in late June. [Read more about the fallout in financial markets on Thursday.] Mr. Trump has been fighting several trade wars at once, wielding tariffs against metals from Europe, Japan, Canada and Mexico as well as goods from China. In response, trading partners have hit back at American farmers, imposing punishing tariffs on items such as peanut butter, soybeans and orange juice. Over the last week, the Trump administration has moved to resolve or delay trade conflicts on other fronts, to better focus its efforts on Beijing. While Mr. Trump has insisted any pain will be short-lived and worth the price, administration officials have grown concerned that the president could lose the support of farmers, an important political constituency, ahead of the 2020 election. China’s tariffs against products like soybeans and beef and a recent move to cancel a major pork order have hit swing states, including Iowa, Ohio and Wisconsin, especially hard. “Farmers are becoming increasingly anxious over their future financial performance,” said James Mintert, the director of Purdue University’s Center for Commercial Agriculture and the principal investigator in a survey of 400 American farmers. The survey — by Purdue University and the CME Group, a global markets company — showed that sentiment plunged in April, stemming from concerns about worsening tensions with China. Only 28 percent of farmers surveyed said they believed a soybean dispute with China would be resolved by July 1, down from 45 percent in March, while 74 percent said that now was a “bad time” to make big farm investments. Those worries helped spur Mr. Trump last week to suddenly drop steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada and Mexico, which agreed in turn to withdraw stiff levies on American farm goods. On Thursday, the Agriculture Department said it would provide up to $16 billion in aid to farmers hurt by trade retaliation. The amount “is in line with the estimated impacts of unjustified retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural goods and other trade disruptions,” the department said in a statement. The financial support came after the administration handed out $12 billion in emergency relief for farmers last year. The new program will make $14.5 billion in direct payments to producers, channeled through the Commodity Credit Corporation, a program that helps shore up American farmers by buying their crops. The payments will be made to agricultural producers for a wide range of products, from soybeans and cotton to chickpeas and cherries, in up to three tranches, beginning in late July or early August. The government will also put in place a $1.4 billion program to purchase surplus commodities affected by the trade war and distribute them to food banks, schools and other programs for the poor, as well as put another $100 million toward developing new export markets for American farmers. In his remarks on Thursday, the president said that China would foot the bill for the program by paying hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs to the United States government. Economists have disputed that, saying the administration has no way to determine who ultimately pays the cost of the tariffs — Chinese businesses, American businesses or American consumers — but that the cost is falling heavily on those in the United States. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said on Thursday that Mr. Trump’s tariffs will cost the average American household $831 annually. Despite the economic pain from his trade war, many farmers continue to support Mr. Trump. But some are not happy about the financial bailout, saying they would prefer freer markets rather than subsidies and tariffs. “It’s still just a Band-Aid,” said Bret Davis, a fourth-generation soybean farmer in Delaware, Ohio. He said he had received roughly $150,000 of bailout money last year, but estimated that his losses due to the trade war were almost $250,000. The trade clash has pushed China, which formerly bought about one-third of American soybeans, to purchase from other markets instead and caused soybean prices in the United States to slump. At the current market price, Mr. Davis said, “I cannot produce a bean and make a dime on it.” “I would lose money on every acre I plant,” he added. Brody Stapel, the president of the Edge Dairy Farmer Cooperative in Green Bay, Wis., said on Thursday that farmers appreciated the financial assistance, but recognized that it would provide only partial and short-term relief. “We much prefer trade over aid,” he said. Republican lawmakers were more supportive. Senator Kevin Cramer, Republican of North Dakota, said he was taken completely by surprise when Mr. Trump signaled this month that he would allocate the new farm money — and was optimistic the president would steer more money to farmers if enough Republicans called him directly to make the request. “It’s a good start,” Mr. Cramer said on Thursday. “If we need more later, we will go through the fight again. We got $16 billion, but maybe we’ll need $20 billion.”"

Mr. Trump, flanked by farmers and ranchers in cowboy hats during remarks at the White House, said China had “taken advantage” of the United States for far too long and vowed to protect an industry that has been “used as a vehicle” by Beijing to hurt America’s economy. “Farmers have been attacked by China,” Mr. Trump said, adding that if the United States is in a trade war, “we’re winning it big.” Global markets tumbled on Thursday as investors began coming to terms with the idea that Mr. Trump’s trade war is here to stay. Benchmark indexes in China, Germany and France all dropped, with the S&P 500 falling 1.2 percent. American crude oil prices were down more than 5 percent, amid growing concern that the trade war would start to drag on global economic demand. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.29 percent at 3 p.m., according to Bloomberg data. That was its lowest closing level this year and a sign that investors were expecting lower levels of growth and inflation. Hopes for a quick resolution to the China trade fight have faded, with both countries hardening their positions after a trade deal collapsed this month. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday that no additional meetings with Beijing were scheduled and that he was encouraging American firms to reorient their supply chains and source their products elsewhere. Progress toward a trade agreement between the United States and China collapsed after American negotiators accused Beijing of reneging on terms it had previously committed to. Significant differences remain over how tariffs should be rolled back between the countries, and whether the negotiated provisions must be enshrined in Chinese law. While both sides initially suggested they would continue talking, Beijing has also begun bracing for a long trade fight. In a defiant statement this week, China’s president, Xi Jinping, called for the Chinese people to begin a modern “long march,” invoking a time of hardship from the country’s history, which many China watchers viewed as a hardening of Beijing’s trade stance. “I am growing more and more skeptical that there is a place where the two sides can come to a deal,” said Edward Alden, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. “If I look at the positions the two sides have taken at the moment, I do not see a path to a deal.” Mr. Trump on Thursday once again suggested that he was happy to keep his trade fight going indefinitely. “I remain hopeful that at some point we’ll get together with China,” he said. “If it happens, great. If it doesn’t happen, that’s fine. That’s absolutely fine.” More companies have been pulling back from doing business with Chinese firms, especially multinationals that provided services to Huawei, the telecommunications equipment giant. The Trump administration announced last week that it would blacklist Huawei over national security concerns, prompting Google and mobile carriers to say they would no longer do business with it. The benchmark index of American semiconductor stocks fell 1.7 percent, as investors continued to grapple with the administration’s efforts to restrict sales to Huawei. On Thursday, the president called Huawei “very dangerous” but said it was “possible” that an arrangement involving the company could be included in a China trade deal. “If we made a deal, I can imagine Huawei being included in some form or some part of a trade deal,” he said.  More restrictions on dealing with Chinese tech companies could come soon. The New York Times reported on Tuesday that the Trump administration was considering another ban on American companies supplying components to Hikvision, a Chinese surveillance camera maker that has been criticized for playing a role in the Chinese government’s monitoring and repression of Uighurs, a mostly Muslim ethnic minority. The crackdown on Chinese technology, coupled with Mr. Trump’s decision to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods and begin the process to tax another $300 billion, has exacerbated tensions with Beijing. The Chinese government has accused the United States of bullying China and vowed to further retaliate on American products, particularly agricultural goods. In a note on Wednesday, analysts from Nomura Global Markets Research said their baseline scenario was that Mr. Trump would put a 25 percent tariff on all Chinese exports to the United States by the end of 2019, most likely after he is scheduled to meet with Mr. Xi at the Group of 20 summit meeting in late June. [Read more about the fallout in financial markets on Thursday.] Mr. Trump has been fighting several trade wars at once, wielding tariffs against metals from Europe, Japan, Canada and Mexico as well as goods from China. In response, trading partners have hit back at American farmers, imposing punishing tariffs on items such as peanut butter, soybeans and orange juice. Over the last week, the Trump administration has moved to resolve or delay trade conflicts on other fronts, to better focus its efforts on Beijing. While Mr. Trump has insisted any pain will be short-lived and worth the price, administration officials have grown concerned that the president could lose the support of farmers, an important political constituency, ahead of the 2020 election. China’s tariffs against products like soybeans and beef and a recent move to cancel a major pork order have hit swing states, including Iowa, Ohio and Wisconsin, especially hard. “Farmers are becoming increasingly anxious over their future financial performance,” said James Mintert, the director of Purdue University’s Center for Commercial Agriculture and the principal investigator in a survey of 400 American farmers. The survey — by Purdue University and the CME Group, a global markets company — showed that sentiment plunged in April, stemming from concerns about worsening tensions with China. Only 28 percent of farmers surveyed said they believed a soybean dispute with China would be resolved by July 1, down from 45 percent in March, while 74 percent said that now was a “bad time” to make big farm investments. Those worries helped spur Mr. Trump last week to suddenly drop steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada and Mexico, which agreed in turn to withdraw stiff levies on American farm goods. On Thursday, the Agriculture Department said it would provide up to $16 billion in aid to farmers hurt by trade retaliation. The amount “is in line with the estimated impacts of unjustified retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural goods and other trade disruptions,” the department said in a statement. The financial support came after the administration handed out $12 billion in emergency relief for farmers last year. The new program will make $14.5 billion in direct payments to producers, channeled through the Commodity Credit Corporation, a program that helps shore up American farmers by buying their crops. The payments will be made to agricultural producers for a wide range of products, from soybeans and cotton to chickpeas and cherries, in up to three tranches, beginning in late July or early August. The government will also put in place a $1.4 billion program to purchase surplus commodities affected by the trade war and distribute them to food banks, schools and other programs for the poor, as well as put another $100 million toward developing new export markets for American farmers. In his remarks on Thursday, the president said that China would foot the bill for the program by paying hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs to the United States government. Economists have disputed that, saying the administration has no way to determine who ultimately pays the cost of the tariffs — Chinese businesses, American businesses or American consumers — but that the cost is falling heavily on those in the United States. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said on Thursday that Mr. Trump’s tariffs will cost the average American household $831 annually. Despite the economic pain from his trade war, many farmers continue to support Mr. Trump. But some are not happy about the financial bailout, saying they would prefer freer markets rather than subsidies and tariffs. “It’s still just a Band-Aid,” said Bret Davis, a fourth-generation soybean farmer in Delaware, Ohio. He said he had received roughly $150,000 of bailout money last year, but estimated that his losses due to the trade war were almost $250,000.

Donald Trump, who may — but probably doesn’t — want a war with the Islamic republic, should propose it, publicly and in detail, and see what happens.  It will be clarifying for everyone. What is normalization? From the U.S. side, it would mean the immediate suspension of every economic and diplomatic sanction imposed by this or previous administrations. It would mean an American Embassy in Tehran and an Iranian one in Washington. It would mean direct flights between Iranian and American cities. It would mean two-way trade, direct investment, and the end of secondary sanctions that punish non-U.S. companies for doing business in Iran. It would mean tens of thousands of Iranian students once again enrolled in U.S. universities, and tens of thousands of American tourists once again exploring the grand bazaars of Iranian cities. Iran’s people could surely use that deal. Since Trump reimposed U.S. sanctions last year, Iran’s oil exports have fallen by more than half, inflation has spiked to close to 40 percent and the rial has lost about 60 percent of its value against the dollar. Iran’s economy is expected to contract by 6 percent this year. By some estimates, a third of all Iranians live in absolute, not relative, poverty, unable to afford the most basic staples of life.  As for the Iranian side, normalization would mean behaving like a normal country. A normal country, with the world’s fourth-largest proven oil reserves, is one that wouldn’t need to embark on multiple underground programs to enrich uranium and produce plutonium. It wouldn’t engage in extensive experimental work to figure out how to detonate a fissile nuclear core. It wouldn’t retain an illicit network to circumvent Western restrictions on the sale of dual-use technologies for its missile programs.  A normal country is one that would not perpetrate terrorist massacres in Argentina. It wouldn’t seek to murder (via a Mexican drug cartel) the Saudi ambassador at a Washington, D.C., restaurant. It wouldn’t attempt an assassination plot in Denmark, or a bombing attack in France.  A normal country would not furnish military, financial and logistical support for Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, who seems to have resumed using chemical weapons against his enemies. It wouldn’t supply the Taliban with weapons, training and new recruits. It wouldn’t provide its proxies in Yemen with ballistic missiles, especially now that those proxies are firing missiles at Mecca. It wouldn’t be a principal sponsor for militias and terrorist groups throughout the Middle East. It wouldn’t constantly avow and seek, at considerable cost to itself, the destruction of another state with which it has neither a historical nor territorial conflict. A normal country wouldn’t hang gay people. It wouldn’t imprison women in their own clothes. It wouldn’t constantly arrest foreign nationals, including American journalists, on trumped-up charges as a means of gaining diplomatic or financial leverage. In short, under the terms of a normalization-for-normalization deal, Iran could relieve itself of all U.S. pressure by permanently abandoning its nuclear ambitions, its human rights outrages and its reckless international behavior. That’s not a big ask. Or at least it shouldn’t be, which is why Trump ought to deliver it in a carefully written speech — the kind normal presidents make about vital international and domestic topics. Mike Pompeo laid out roughly similar terms in his own speech on Iran a year ago, but his tone was more bellicose than beguiling. Trump prefers the combination of brash moves with simple messages. This would be it. It would also be unlikely to win over Iran’s leaders. Death to America — and to Israel — aren’t propagandistic slogans for the regime. They are its reason for being and its motive for action. The regime’s objections to the United States don’t date to 1953 and U.S. connivance in the ouster of Mohammad Mosaddegh as prime minister of Iran (a coup the clerics supported at the time). They date to 1776 and the birth of political liberalism, the enemy of all theocratic and virtue-centric politics. An American bombing campaign in Iran could hurt the regime. Complete and genuine normalization would, over time, be fatal to it. It would mean, as Trump put it the other day, Iran’s “official end” — not as a nation, but as the regime that has tyrannized that nation for 40 years. Last week’s saber-rattling is unlikely to lead to a confrontation neither side wants. Trump thinks that avoiding war is crucial to his re-election. Tehran thinks Trump is more likely to be a one-termer if it can wait him out without a war. These are incompatible analyses, but they should induce mutual caution. All the more reason for Trump to seize the initiative. Normalization for normalization is a concept this and future U.S. administrations could embrace. It’s one ordinary Americans and Iranians alike could understand. And it’s one Iran’s leaders would fear. Let them be the ones to explain why Iranian children should go hungry so Hamas can aim its fire at Jews. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

In… [+2491 chars]",the-new-york-times,The New York Times,"AMHERST, Mass. — President Trump’s call for regime change in Venezuela is eliciting criticism from both sides of the political spectrum. The far left is denouncing imperialism; the far right is complaining about hesitancy. This debate overlooks what is perhaps a more serious problem with America’s new approach to Venezuela: It’s shedding the very allies that the country’s democratic forces need, while strengthening international opponents. In other words, coalition mismanagement. The Hands Off Venezuela! camp contends that the United States is acting in its own interest and that intervention would worsen conditions on the ground. In contrast, conservatives contend that United States policy lacks teeth. By not intervening more forcefully, the United States is leaving democratic forces on the ground disarmed and vulnerable to repression. Both sides overstate their case. It took significant human rights violations, coupled with persistent lobbying by the opposition and international allies, to shift United States policy toward Venezuela from ambivalence to a firm commitment to democracy. The Trump administration is basing policy on facts for once; they’ve come to understand that when a semi-failed narco state is left unchecked, as isolationists would want, citizens and neighbors pay the price. Likewise, conservatives may be downplaying the power of the new United States approach. The Trump administration has introduced sanctions that have cut off the Nicolás Maduro regime from a critical source of financing, and it has offered sanctions relief to military officers who betray the dictator. While mass defections have yet to materialize, for the first time since he took power, some officers are abandoning him in favor of the leader of the opposition, Juan Guaidó. Defections are the first step toward a democratic transition, and while they have been far fewer than Mr. Trump would have wanted, they have been more significant than conservatives have conceded. Lost in the left-right debate is how Mr. Trump is failing to manage the international actors involved in the Venezuelan standoff. Regime change requires effective management of these actors. This includes the group of more than 50 countries that support democracy in Venezuela. The United States, to its credit, played a constructive role in helping the Venezuelan opposition forge this coalition of allies. But now the United States is adopting policies that weaken the coalition. In March, Mr. Trump slammed President Iván Duque of Colombia — a key ally — saying “he has done nothing” to contain a recent surge in coca exports. This public humiliation has forced Mr. Duque to bow to pressure and adopt unpopular conservative positions like reneging on some aspects of the 2016 peace accords with guerrillas and asking the courts to roll back a judicial ban on aerial spraying of glyphosate — an herbicide linked to cancer — to eliminate coca crops. The more he moves to the right, the more his poll numbers decline. The United States is effectively weakening one of the most important pro-democracy actors in the region. Mr. Trump’s recent hard-line stance toward Cuba is also likely to alienate two other key partners: Spain and Canada. In mid-April, the Trump administration announced that it would allow United States citizens to sue any corporation that “traffics” in property confiscated by the Cuban government. As two of Cuba’s most important trading partners, Spain and Canada will bear the costs of this policy. This is no way to reward members of the pro-democracy coalition. The United States should be trying to engage Mexico, which has adopted a neutral position on the question of Venezuela. Instead bilateral relations between the two countries have been strained by Mr. Trump’s continued hard-line immigration policies. Tensions escalated in March when Mr. Trump threatened to close the border. This intransigence over immigration only helps bolster the popularity of Mexico’s left-wing president, eliminating any leverage the opposition in Mexico could use to pressure the president to change his policy toward Venezuela to align with Mr. Trump’s. Worse still has been the Trump administration’s treatment of Russia and China, the most important adversaries of the pro-democracy coalition. The right strategy would have been to take a cue from Henry Kissinger’s Cold War playbook: Pit China against Russia. In Venezuela, this would not have been unimaginable. China was the most important actor in the country until the Russians arrived to ransack it. Venezuela’s economic devastation left underutilized, underinvested and undervalued assets in its wake. Russians began acquiring many of those assets in 2017, becoming the country’s new patron in the process. The biggest loser was China. The United States had an opportunity to convince China that deposing Mr. Maduro was the first step not just in returning value to Chinese investments but also in empowering China vis-à-vis Russia in Venezuela. On May 3, Mr. Trump discussed Venezuela with President Vladimir Putin of Russia during an hourlong call. He later shocked everyone, including his own secretary of state, by stating that the Russians were “not looking at all to get involved in Venezuela,” sounding more like Russia’s ambassador to the United Nations than the president of the United States. Worse, two days later he escalated the trade war with China, imposing 25 percent tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods. Not surprisingly, China retaliated. In the meantime, the United States has expressed no qualms about oil imports from Russia, which have increased since Venezuela’s oil collapse in another example of how Russia profits from the status quo in Venezuela. In other words, Mr. Trump has been playing soft with Russia while antagonizing China. The Chinese now have more reason to be angry at Mr. Trump than at Mr. Putin. The problem with the United States’ policy toward Venezuela is not that it’s imperialist or too cautionary, but rather that Trumpism is getting in the way of declared goals. Mr. Trump’s visceral disdain for Latin Americans, his inexplicable submission to Mr. Putin and his irrational dislike of trade with China are sabotaging the chances of using effective international pressure to bring about democracy in Venezuela. Mr. Trump is neither pursuing nor ignoring United States interests. He is hurting them.

Sign up here.) The company suppressed competition in the smartphone chip market and then charged excessive licensing fees, a federal judge has ruled. “Qualcomm’s licensing practices have strangled competition” in key parts of the modem chip market, the judge, Lucy Koh of the U.S. District Court in San Jose, wrote. That “harmed rivals, O.E.M.s, and end consumers in the process,” she added. The company must now strike new licensing agreements with its customers that are free from “onerous” fees for the use of its patents. Qualcomm must also be monitored for the next seven years to ensure that it complies with the remedies. Qualcomm is considered the industry leader in wireless modem chips, an ever-more-important position as the race to develop next-generation 5G wireless networks accelerates. The case has been closely watched since a similar lawsuit between Apple and Qualcomm was settled last month. Apple’s willingness to back down was seen as a sign of how far ahead Qualcomm is on 5G modem chips. The administration’s efforts to block China’s technology industry from the U.S. ratcheted up when it limited Huawei’s ability to buy products from American suppliers. Now it looks ready to expand that campaign: • The White House is considering limiting the Chinese video surveillance company Hikvision’s ability to buy American technology, Ana Swanson and Edward Wong of the NYT report. • Four other Chinese surveillance companies could join the black list, Bloomberg reports. • The U.S. government has also warned that Chinese-made drones could pose a cyberespionage risk to American businesses. • And the U.S. “has sharply slowed approvals for the nation’s semiconductor companies to hire Chinese nationals for advanced engineering jobs” in a bid to protect U.S. know-how, the WSJ reports. “China poses an economic, technological and geopolitical threat that cannot be left unchecked,” in the eyes of the Trump administration, Ms. Swanson and Mr. Wong write. Fears of a tech cold war are real. Pony Ma, the head of the Chinese tech giant Tencent, said that he was “constantly watching whether the trade war will turn into a tech war,” according to a CNBC translation of remarks that he made recently. “If we don’t continue to work hard on basic research and key technologies, our digital economy will just be a high-rise built on sand.” China still relies heavily on imported computer chips. And Huawei is scrambling to find allies. Yesterday it “implored European governments to resist American pressure,” according to the WSJ. (Europe, the Middle East and Africa generated 28 percent of Huawei’s revenue last year.) Unnamed U.S. officials told Bloomberg that their European counterparts were coming around to the Trump administration’s thinking about Huawei and national security. President Xi Jinping of China warned his country to get ready for a protracted trade fight with the U.S., Alex Stevenson of the NYT writes. “There is a new long march, and we should make a new start,” Mr. Xi told a cheering crowd yesterday at the start of a domestic campaign meant to rally China. The Long March of 1934 was a pivotal moment in the history of China’s Communist Party that led to Mao Zedong seizing power from Nationalists. Mr. Xi did not specifically mention trade, but his comments appear to be the strongest signal yet that Beijing no longer expects a deal with the U.S. any time soon. Beijing is stirring up nationalist fervor in other ways, too. Chinese state media has compared the trade war to the Korean War, in which Chinese troops fought American forces. U.S. companies are girding themselves for long-term pain. Several American retailers are taking steps to avoid raising prices because of tariffs on Chinese imports. One, Kohl’s, also lowered its financial guidance for the rest of the year. The I.R.S. has no choice but to honor congressional requests for President Trump’s tax returns unless he invokes executive privilege to protect them, according to a draft legal memo written by agency staffers, Alan Rappeport of the NYT reports. That appears to contradict Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, “who has refused to comply with Democrats’ requests because they lack a ‘legitimate legislative purpose,’ ” Mr. Rappeport writes. “Mr. Mnuchin said he made his decision after consulting with lawyers from the Treasury Department, the I.R.S. and the Justice Department.” The draft memo was written last fall, an I.R.S. spokesman told the NYT. “The current I.R.S. commissioner, Charles P. Rettig, and its chief counsel, Michael Desmond, were not aware of it until this week,” Mr. Rappeport adds. “The memo was not sent to the Treasury Department.” “It is not the official position of the I.R.S.,” the spokesman said. Mr. Mnuchin is scheduled to testify this morning before the House Financial Services Committee, “and is likely to be grilled by Democrats about the decision not to hand over the returns,” Mr. Rappeport writes. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase have long dominated the business of taking companies public. But after Uber and Lyft’s flawed debuts, rivals are circling, the FT finds. The three banks claimed 55 percent of tech I.P.O. underwriting fees last year, the data provider Refinitiv says, from an estimated total of more than $400 million. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs (along with Bank of America) were Uber’s lead underwriters; JPMorgan (along with Credit Suisse and Jefferies) were Lyft’s. Rivals say the Uber and Lyft failures are cause for a shake-up. Uber has never traded above its I.P.O. price of $45 a share, and Lyft is down 23 percent from its I.P.O. price of $72 a share.  “The quality of deal execution” is being questioned by companies and venture capitalists, David Hermer, the head of equity capital markets at Credit Suisse, told the FT. But I.P.O. candidates may prefer to play safe. Morgan Stanley, Goldman and JPMorgan are plugged into Silicon Valley, and have the broadest connections with potential investors in almost all offerings. “You are not going to do something crazy”  if you choose a “tried and true” adviser, said Howard Lerman, who picked Morgan Stanley to lead the I.P.O. of his company, Yext, in 2017. More: A case against the rule change that let Uber stay private so long.  In newly filed accusations, McDonald’s employees have described repeated sexual harassment and then punishment for speaking out, Melena Ryzik of the NYT writes. • “The Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund, formed last year to extend the muscle of the #MeToo movement beyond Hollywood, has taken aim at sexual harassment on the fast food chain’s assembly lines.” • With the American Civil Liberties Union and the labor group Fight for $15, it has “announced the filing of 23 new complaints against McDonald’s — 20 sent to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission; three filed as civil rights lawsuits; and two suits stemming from previous allegations.” • Workers accuse McDonald’s of “gender-based discrimination, sexual harassment in the workplace and retaliation for speaking up.” • “McDonald’s is a strategic target. The restaurant industry has one of the highest rates of workplace sexual harassment; in one survey, 40 percent of female fast food workers said they had experienced it.” • “The company’s dominant role in the economy makes the campaign a major test of the legal and labor power of the #MeToo movement.” Avon, once a giant in the cosmetics industry, has agreed to sell itself to a Brazilian rival, Natura Cosmeticos, according to press reports. The transaction could be announced as soon as today. The all-stock deal would be valued at about $2 billion, according to the FT, citing unnamed sources. Natura would own about 76 percent of the combined business. Natura already owns the Body Shop and Aesop brands, and has sought to expand globally. “The deal would mark the end of the independence of an icon of 20th-century business, which has fallen on hard times as consumer tastes and buying habits have shifted,” the WSJ notes. Avon, which became a powerhouse through door-to-door sales, lost ground to online sales, which it was slow to embrace. Avon had already spun out its North American business, which was sold in April to LG Household & Health Care of Korea for $125 million. One big winner: Cerberus Capital Management, which controlled Avon’s North American unit and has a big stake in the remainder of the business. The White House is vetting Judy Shelton, a conservative economist who favors changing interest-rate policy, for a seat on the Fed board. President Trump plans to nominate Brent McIntosh, the Treasury Department’s general counsel, as its undersecretary for international affairs. The Trump administration is expected to name Ken Cuccinelli, the former attorney general of Virginia, as its immigration policy coordinator. The investment firm Silver Lake has hired Barrett Karr, the chief of staff for the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, as its head of government relations.

C… [+1455 chars]",the-new-york-times,The New York Times,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning, We start today with a last-ditch Brexit plan that’s not promising, a new kind of anti-Semitism in Germany and what chocolate and cement have in common. Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain dangled the prospect of a second referendum before lawmakers, in a desperate effort to win over those who have rejected her plan three times.  Her “new Brexit deal,” as she described it, would give Parliament a broader role in shaping her plan. But the part that drew the most attention was her vague offer to have lawmakers vote on whether to have a second referendum, something she had previously ruled out. It was unclear what questions any referendum would pose.  The plan seemed designed to entice pro-Brexit Labour Party lawmakers to support her Brexit blueprint.  Key issues: Her plan includes the opportunity for Parliament to decide whether to keep a type of customs union with Brussels, eliminating tariffs and reducing checks on goods at frontiers. Another issue is the Irish border, and the deal would commit the government to working on measures to track goods.  Response: The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said his party would not support the plan. Pro-Brexit Conservatives have also reacted angrily.  Reminder: Mrs. May essentially promised to step down no matter what lawmakers decide about her plan. The vote on Brexit legislation is set for the week beginning June 3.  Some 200,000 Jews live in Germany, a nation of 82 million people, and many are increasingly fearful in the face of new forms of anti-Semitism.  The country’s culture of remembrance of the Holocaust has been held up as a model. But its ideals are not universally supported at home. Anti-Semitic crimes in Germany increased by nearly 20 percent last year, to 1,799. And in an E.U. survey of European Jews in 2018, 85 percent of respondents in Germany characterized anti-Semitism as a “very big” or “fairly big” problem. Context: In the decades that followed the Holocaust, a desire among many Germans to deflect or repress their guilt led to a new form of antipathy toward Jews. That phenomenon came to be known as “secondary anti-Semitism,” in which Germans resent Jews for reminding them of their guilt, reversing the victim and perpetrator roles. Complications: It can be difficult to determine the root of anti-Semitic crimes. When researchers looked at all reported anti-Semitic incidents in Berlin in 2018, they were unable to determine the ideological motivation in nearly half the cases. Political stage: In 2017, the far-right Alternative for Germany became the German Parliament’s third-largest party. Its politicians have often relativized Nazi crimes to counteract what some of them call a national “guilt cult.” Since his election two years ago, President Emmanuel Macron of France has fashioned himself as the leader of Europe, laying out a grand vision of deeper integration that has turned off populists and even his allies. Mr. Macron’s vision now faces its most critical test in elections for the European Parliament that start on Thursday. Polls in France show his party trailing Marine Le Pen’s far-right Rassemblement National, or National Rally.  “We can’t let people think this is just an ordinary moment,” one of Mr. Macron’s advisers said. “Europe is at risk, and everyone has got to be conscious of it.” Big picture: Defeat for Mr. Macron would be a stinging humiliation for him amid months of Yellow Vest protests. It could also kill his vision of a united Europe.  European elections: Have questions on how the dayslong elections for European Parliament work? Read our explainer. When making chocolate or mixing cement, stirring tiny granules in a fluid results in a substance with very specific properties — for chocolate, it’s a meltingly smooth mouthfeel, and for cement, it’s a cohesive, consistent texture. A team of physicists, funded in part by Mars, the confectionary company, published a paper last week showing just what happens as the ingredients of chocolate are given a stir on their way to becoming a delicious treat — what is known as chocolate conching. Venezuela: Weakened and unable to bring the country’s political crisis to a quick resolution, the opposition leader Juan Guaidó has been forced to consider negotiations with President Nicolás Maduro. Both sides have sent representatives to Norway for talks. Colombia: The army walked back part of a contentious policy to step up attacks in the country, saying it would change its pledge forms in which officers are required to list the number of criminals and militants they plan to kill, capture or force to surrender in battle. U.S.: A State Department policy that has come under intense scrutiny requires a child born abroad to have a biological connection to an American parent in order to receive citizenship at birth. For those who use assisted reproductive technology, citizenship can get complicated, and critics say the policy discriminates against same-sex couples. Trade war: As tensions between the U.S. and China escalate, President Xi Jinping called for the Chinese people to begin a modern “long march,” invoking a turning point in Communist Party history in an attempt to rally the nation. Hungary: Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s government has caged and starved refugees, the Council of Europe’s human rights commissioner reported. Britain: A man in northeastern England threw a banana and salted caramel milkshake at Nigel Farage, the prominent and divisive Brexit leader. It was the latest in a string of similar milkshake incidents.  Austria: Chancellor Sebastian Kurz has called for an early election to recover from the scandal that struck his far-right coalition partners. But the situation may be out of his control after opposition parties proposed a vote of no confidence against Mr. Kurz. Belgium: After refusing for months, King Albert II will soon give a DNA sample, his lawyer said this week, in a lawsuit brought by a woman who says she is his daughter, neglected and kept secret for decades. He will fight to keep it private.  Snapshot: Above, a hiking trail in the village of Stary Smokovec, Slovakia, where our 52 Places columnist found himself alone but happy.

The mobile technology known as 5G is in the news for its promise of superfast smartphone connections, as well as concerns about national security. But 5G networks may have unintended consequences for meteorology. The Federal Communications Commission has begun auctioning U.S. rights to radio frequencies for 5G use. And there is a concern, first raised in an internal memo by a U.S. Navy officer, that one of them will interfere with a nearby frequency that is crucial for meteorologists around the world: the natural frequency of water vapor.  Monitoring water vapor yields valuable data that can be fed into weather-modeling programs. Forecasters can’t just switch to another band — there would be no water-vapor data there. In a letter to the Trump administration last week, two senators warned that the accuracy of forecasts could be set back 50 years, a big loss given that extreme weather events are on the rise.

Over the weekend Chinas national movie channel, CCTV-6, ra… [+951 chars]",the-new-york-times,The New York Times,"BEIJING — President Xi Jinping of China has called for the Chinese people to begin a modern “long march,” invoking a time of hardship from the country’s history as it braces for a protracted trade war with the United States. Mr. Xi’s call, made on Monday, referred to the Long March, a grueling 4,000-mile, one-year journey undertaken by Communist Party forces in 1934 as they fled the Nationalist army under Chiang Kai-shek. From there, they regrouped and eventually took control of China in 1949, making the Long March one of the party’s foundational legends. The comments appear intended to stir the spirit of the Chinese people as the Trump administration continues to press China on trade. But they also seem to acknowledge that the Chinese public could face difficult times ahead. The tariffs come as Beijing tries to lift the economy out of a slowdown, and as a variety of unrelated factors raise the prices of basic food items like pork and fruit for the average Chinese shopper. Speaking at the site of the start of the Long March in Jiangxi Province, Mr. Xi told a crowd of cheering locals that “now there is a new long march, and we should make a new start.” He did not mention the trade war directly, and Mr. Xi has used the term “the new Long March” in speeches before to exhort officials, military officials or ordinary citizens to follow his policies. But the visit, broadcast on state-run television on Tuesday, came as tensions flare between the world’s two biggest economies. Among the officials with Mr. Xi was Liu He, his chief economic adviser and top trade negotiator. On Wednesday, Mr. Xi told another audience in Jiangxi that the country “must be conscious of the long-term and complex nature of various unfavorable factors at home and abroad, and properly prepare for the various difficult situations.” The trade war shows little sign of letting up. In the latest move, the Trump administration is considering placing a Chinese company called Hikvision on a list that would limit its ability to procure American technology like chips and software to meet its needs. The company, which provides equipment for China’s growing surveillance state, said in a statement on Wednesday that it “has never in the past done any business that requires us to violate human rights.” At a daily news briefing on Wednesday, Lu Kang, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said, “China opposes the U.S. practice of abusing state power and arbitrarily discrediting and suppressing foreign enterprises, including Chinese enterprises.” In one of the first gestures hinting at a potential opening salvo, Mr. Xi on Monday visited a rare earths mine in the city of Ganzhou, which some observers saw as an attempt to remind Mr. Trump of the leverage that China has when it comes to certain resources. Rare earths are found in many of the electronics that the world uses every day, and China is the largest source. China has used its control of rare earths to exert pressure before, most notably in 2010 when it halted all exports to Japan for two months over a territorial dispute. Mr. Xi later called on the industry to continue to “intensify efforts” to develop rare earths, calling them a “strategic resource.” At a media briefing on Wednesday, officials told reporters not to read too much into the visit, adding that it was a routine visit. The Chinese state media has ratcheted up nationalistic rhetoric in the past few days, comparing the trade war to the Korean War, during which Chinese troops were in direct combat with American forces. Over the weekend, China’s national movie channel, CCTV-6, ran back-to-back films about the Korean War, saying that the footage was “echoing present times.” The central point of those films is that “there’s no equal negotiation without fighting,” Hu Xijin, the editor of Global Times, a newspaper owned by the Communist Party, wrote on Twitter over the weekend. China in the past has successfully rallied its people to target businesses owned by Japanese and South Korean companies during disputes with those countries. With the trade war with the United States, China has to move more carefully. American products are often made in Chinese factories, and China needs its consumers to keep spending as it tries to turn around its growth slump. Chinese consumers also have more immediate concerns. Even as the economic slowdown appeared to be stabilizing, certain living costs have risen steeply. A vicious African swine fever that swept across China has led to more than a million pigs being culled, driving up the price of pork. A steep increase in the price of vegetables and fruit has led many people to complain online that they no longer have “fruit freedom” — the ability to buy as much fruit as they like. “Everyone has personally felt a rise in prices,” said Zhang Lifan, a historian and former businessman. “Normal people will have to bear the consequences of the Chinese trade war. There is no way to fight this, and the new Long March is not sustainable,” Mr. Zhang said. For people like Xu Jifeng, who works for an American telecommunications company in Beijing, the back and forth between China and the United States has little bearing on his day-to-day life. He said he would most likely choose a Huawei phone over an Apple phone the next time he needs to upgrade. But he was more interested in talking about the rising cost of produce. Mr. Xu, 44, said the price of a watermelon has gone up by more than a dollar. “I think this reflects the bad overall state of the economy,” Mr. Xu said. “The government says it’s just temporary and that they will keep it under control.” “But coming at the same time as these China-U.S. trade frictions, I think fruit prices must be showing the effects.” In April, the price of pork jumped 14 percent compared with a year earlier, while the broader food consumer price inflation rose 6.1 percent, according to government statistics. By the end of last week, the average price of a basket of fruit had hit a nearly five-year high of $1.10 a kilogram, according to official statistics. So many people online were talking about the rising costs of fruit that #fruitfreedom became a top trending topic on Weibo, China’s most popular social media site. The National Bureau of Statistics blamed the weather, and said that the price increase was short-term. “The price increase of fresh fruits will not continue to be high,” a spokeswoman for the bureau said. People have responded online by posting photographs of fruit with commentary about how much less they can afford. One woman complained that her usual haul of fruit from the supermarket was costing her nearly as much as she would pay for a new lipstick. One person wrote on Weibo, “Now the price of fruit is really more expensive than meat. From now on, when I eat apples, I don’t dare to peel the skin, not even spit out the seeds.” Another asked “Where is fruit freedom? All I can achieve is cold water freedom.”"

Trump’s instinct that America needs to rebalance its trade relationship with Beijing — before China gets too big to compromise — is correct. And it took a human wrecking ball like Trump to get China’s attention. But now that we have it, both countries need to recognize just how pivotal this moment is.  The original U.S.-China opening back in the 1970s defined our restored trade ties, which were limited. When we let China join the World Trade Organization in 2001, it propelled China into a trading powerhouse under rules that still gave China lots of concessions as a developing economy. This new negotiation will define how the U.S. and China relate as economic peers, competing for the same 21st-century industries, at a time when our markets are totally intertwined. So this is no ordinary trade dispute. This is the big one. For it to end well, Trump will have to stop with his juvenile taunting of China on Twitter (and talking about how trade wars are “easy” to win) and quietly forge the best rebalancing deal we can get — we probably can’t fix everything at once — and move on, without stumbling unthinkingly into a forever tariff war. And China’s president, Xi Jinping, will have to recognize that China can no longer enjoy the trading privileges it has had over the last 40 years, so he’d be wise to curb his nationalistic “no-one-tells-China-what-to-do” bluster and look for the best win-win deal he can get. Because Beijing can’t afford America and others shifting their manufacturing to “ABC,” Anywhere-But-China, supply chains. Here is how we got here: Since the 1970s, the U.S.-China trade relationship has been pretty constant: We bought China’s toys, T-shirts, tennis shoes, machine tools and solar panels, and it bought our soybeans, beef and Boeings. And when the trade balance got too out of whack — because China grew not only by hard work, by building smart infrastructure and by educating its people, but also by forcing technology transfers from U.S. companies, subsidizing its own companies, maintaining high tariffs, ignoring W.T.O. rulings and stealing intellectual property — Beijing placated us by buying more Boeings, beef and soybeans. China kept insisting it was still “a poor developing country” that needed extra protection long after it had become the world’s largest manufacturer by far. Nevertheless, the relationship worked for enough U.S. companies enough of the time that the world’s biggest incumbent superpower, America, accommodated and effectively facilitated the rise of the world’s next largest superpower, China. And together they made globalization more pervasive and the world more prosperous. And then some changes too big to ignore set in. First, China under Xi announced a “Made in China 2025” modernization plan, promising subsidies to make China’s private and state-owned companies the world leaders in supercomputing, A.I., new materials, 3-D printing, facial-recognition software, robotics, electric cars, autonomous vehicles, 5G wireless and advanced microchips. This was a natural move for a China aiming to leap out of the middle-income ranks and to reduce its dependency on the West for high-tech. But all these new industries compete directly with America’s best companies. As a result, all China’s subsidies, protectionism, cheating on trade rules, forced technology transfers and stealing of intellectual property since the 1970s became a much greater threat. If the U.S. and Europe allowed China to continue operating by the same formula that it had used to grow from poverty to compete for all the industries of the future, we’d be crazy. Trump is right about that. Where he is wrong is that trade is not like war. Unlike war, it can be a win-win proposition. Alibaba, UnionPay, Baidu and Tencent and Google, Amazon, Facebook and Visa can all win at the same time — and they have been. I’m not sure Trump understands that. But I’m not sure Xi does, either. We have to let China win fair and square where its companies are better, but it has to be ready to lose fair and square, too. Who can say how much more prosperous Google and Amazon would be today if they had been able to operate as freely in China as Alibaba and Tencent can operate in America? And how much money did China save — to subsidize its own companies — when its military stole the plans for Lockheed Martin’s F-35 stealth fighter and then made its own carbon copy, avoiding all the R & D costs? I repeat: Trade can be win-win, but the winning shares can be distorted when one side is working hard and cheating at the same time. We could look the other way when trade was just about toys and solar panels, but when it’s about F-35s and 5G telecommunications, that’s not smart. But that’s not all that is new and problematic. We now live in the age of “dual use.” In a dual-use world, “everything that makes us powerful and prosperous also makes us vulnerable,” noted John Arquilla, one of the top strategists at the Naval Postgraduate School. In particular, 5G equipment like that made by China’s Huawei, which can transfer data and voices at hyperspeed, can also serve as an espionage platform, if China’s intelligence services exercise their right under Chinese law to demand access. Indeed, the controversy around Huawei shines a spotlight on this whole new moment: Huawei increasingly dominates the global market for 5G infrastructure, which used to be controlled by Ericsson and Nokia. America’s Qualcomm is both a supplier of chips and software to Huawei and a global competitor. But the Chinese government has curbed competition against Huawei in China — by both foreign and Chinese companies — to enable Huawei to grow bigger, more quickly and cheaply. Huawei then uses that clout and pricing power to undercut Western telecoms and then uses its rising global market dominance to set the next generation of global 5G telecom standards around its own technologies, not those of Qualcomm or Sweden’s Ericsson. Moreover, in a dual-use world, you have to worry that if you have a Huawei chatbot in your home, an equivalent of Amazon’s Echo, you could also be talking to Chinese military intelligence. In the old days, when we were just buying China’s tennis shoes and solar panels and it our soybeans and Boeings, who cared if the Chinese were Communists, Maoists, socialists — or cheats? But when Huawei is competing on the next generation of 5G telecom with Qualcomm, AT&T and Verizon — and 5G will become the new backbone of digital commerce, communication, health care, transportation and education — values matter, differences in values matters, a modicum of trust matters and the rule of law matters. This is especially true when 5G technologies and standards, once embedded in a country, become very hard to displace. And then add one more thing: The gap in values and trust between us and China is widening, not narrowing. For decades, America and Europe tolerated a certain amount of cheating from China on trade, because they assumed that as China became more prosperous — thanks to trade and capitalist reforms — it would also become more open politically. That was happening until about a decade ago. For the last decade, though, said James McGregor, one of the most knowledgeable U.S. business consultants in China and a longtime resident there, it’s been clear that Beijing, instead of “reforming and opening, has been reforming and closing.” Instead of China getting richer and becoming more of a responsible stakeholder in globalization, it was getting richer and militarizing islands in the South China Sea to push the U.S. out. And it was using high-tech tools, like facial recognition, to become more efficient at authoritarian control, not less. All of this is now coming to a head in these trade talks. Either the U.S. and China find a way to build greater trust — so globalization can continue apace and we can grow together in this new era — or they won’t. In which case, globalization will start to fracture, and we’ll both be poorer for it. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

The rally followed the U.S. government's decision to temporarily ease off proposed restrictions on technology sales to Chinese companies. The news gave a boost to technology sector stocks, which took steep losses a day earlier when the Trump administration announced curbs on technology sales, aimed primarily at Chinese telecom gear maker Huawei. About one-third of that company's suppliers are American chipmakers and the move would crimp sales for companies including Qualcomm and Broadcom. Both companies posted gains Tuesday, along with other chipmakers. The U.S. government's decision to issue a 90-day grace period on technology sales to Huawei, ZTE and other Chinese companies also relieved worries on Wall Street about yet another escalation in the trade war between the U.S. and China. ""I'm a bit surprised that the bounce back has been as strong as it has been,"" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading & derivatives at Charles Schwab. ""It speaks to the fact that we're still in a bull market and, in general, the economics are still pretty solid, and the markets are happy to move up on any sort of positive news, especially if it looks constructive toward trade."" The S&P 500 index rose 24.13 points, or 0.9%, to 2,864.36. The Dow gained 197.43 points, or 0.8%, to 25,877.33. The technology heavy Nasdaq composite climbed 83.35 points, or 1.1%, to 7,785.72, erasing a good chunk of Monday's losses. The Russell 2000 index of small companies picked up 20.28 points, or 1.3%, to 1,545.25. Major stock indexes in Europe rose. Bond prices fell, boosting the yield on the 10-year Treasury to 2.43% from 2.41% late Monday. Heightened tensions over trade have stuck the market in a rut for the last two weeks — the S&P 500 is down 2.8% for May, although the benchmark index still shows a gain of 14.3% for the year. The trend is a change from the relative calm that dominated markets earlier this year, when a trade agreement seemed to be in the works. The S&P 500 has twice dropped by at least 1.5% this month, as many times as it had in the first four months of the year. ""The trade negotiation with China is pretty much the big elephant in the room and continues to be,"" Frederick said. ""Which is why we're going to continue to see above average volatility like we've seen for the last two weeks, and it's a kind of treacherous spot for people to be in right now."" The dispute between Washington and Beijing grew more heated the last two weeks after the Trump administration made good on a threat to raise tariffs on Chinese-made products and China retaliated with tariffs of its own. The U.S. government's restrictions on technology sales to Huawei added more anxiety for traders already worried about further escalations in the trade dispute. But the temporary delay on the restriction of sales to Huawei announced Tuesday, as well as the government saying that the 90-day grace period could be renewed, appeared to alleviate some of those concerns. The rally particularly benefited chipmakers, which had slumped on Monday. Intel rose 2.1% and Texas Instruments added 2.2%. Broadcom, which gets about half of its revenue from China, gained 1%. Qualcomm, which gets more than half of its revenue from China, rose 1.5%. Technology stocks, especially chipmakers, have already been under increased pressure because of the ongoing trade war. The latest move to restrict some technology sales could cut into key revenue sources. Apple rebounded 1.9% after falling a day earlier. Health care, financial and industrial stocks also helped drive the market higher Tuesday. Anthem climbed 4%, Wells Fargo added 1.9% and Boeing gained 1.7%. Household goods makers lagged. Tyson Foods slid 1.5%. Gains in consumer-oriented stocks were held back by disappointing quarterly financial results from a couple of big department store chains. J.C. Penney slid 7% after it reported declining sales and a surprisingly wide loss. The retailer attributed part of the weak quarter to its no longer selling major appliances and furniture. Kohl's plunged 12.3% after its results fell short of forecasts amid slumping sales. The company also cut its profit forecast for the year. The latest corporate results nearly cap an earnings season that has been better than the severe earnings recession that Wall Street initially feared. Energy futures finished mixed Tuesday. Benchmark U.S. crude slipped 0.2% to settle at $62.99 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, closed 0.3% higher at $72.18 per barrel. Wholesale gasoline gained 0.5% to $2.02 per gallon.

It is goodness, she argues, that is truly glamorous. It is goodness that possesses the capacity to shock us; goodness alone that is always “new, marvelous, intoxicating.” It has been four years since Dylann Roof walked into a Bible study group at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., and killed nine people, including the pastor, the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, in a hail of more than 70 bullets. “I have to do this,” Roof said to the group at one point. “Y’all raping all our white women and taking over the nation.” The oldest of Roof’s victims was 87-year-old Susie Jackson; the youngest was Jackson’s 26-year-old grandnephew, Tywanza Sanders, who reached out to touch her curly hair as they lay dying. Tywanza’s mother, Felicia Sanders, survived by rubbing her body in her son’s blood and playing dead. President Obama was in his Marine One helicopter, formulating a public statement about the tragedy and the recent spate of mass shootings — there had been 23 in the five years of his presidency — when the news broke that family members of the victims had publicly forgiven Roof. “Hold off on the statistics,” Obama told his staffers. “That’s what I want to put the spotlight on.” A monstrous act of terrorism became a transfixing narrative of grace and forgiveness. Roof — as banal as Simone Weil predicted, with his garbled ambition for sparking a race war — was eclipsed by his victims, the richness of their lives, the dignity and spiritual power of their families. Spotlights, of course, reveal by concealing. In “Grace Will Lead Us Home,” Jennifer Berry Hawes, a Polk Award- and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, offers a fuller, more complicated picture of the massacre and its aftermath. A reporter for the Charleston-based Post and Courier (her children attended the school across the street from the church), she covered the tragedy extensively, and drew on her long relationships with the families in writing this book. “They weren’t the homogeneous group of forgiving people the world wanted them to be,” she writes. During sentencing, “some screamed at Roof, calling him evil. Several hoped he burned in hell for eternity. They called him a coward. Satan. An animal. A monster.” The narrative of forgiveness was alluring, in part, because it seemed to so quickly suture the wound; if the families had forgiven Roof, what need for self-examination or substantive change? White residents of Charleston held that tensions had actually lessened in their city; they were twice as likely as their black counterparts to say that race relations had improved as a direct result of the mass murder. Hawes is a poised writer and a patient observer who trains her focus on the present. She gestures briefly to Charleston’s role as the epicenter of the nation’s slave trade (“as the Civil War approached almost three in four white families here had owned slaves”) and the long history of attacks on black churches, including Emanuel, which was first burned to the ground in 1822. Her primary interest is in the lives of the survivors and the families of the victims, “the people who will live this story forever.” For most, trauma begat trauma: health problems, even sudden deaths. One widower lost 60 pounds and became unable to return to work. Bitter divisions flared. Eleven months after the shooting, Sharon Risher and Nadine Collier, two daughters of Ethel Lance, one of Roof’s victims, couldn’t even agree on a headstone for their mother. When Risher finally had one erected over the grave, Collier installed her own version directly in front of it. At one point, according to the author, Risher felt it was more likely that she might forgive Dylann Roof than her sister. Even those who fought to return to some semblance of normalcy found that their lives had become uncomfortably public. Private people felt forced into activism and advocacy even as the shootings had left them adrift — and they felt spiritually abandoned by their church (which itself became mired in controversy after donations went missing). Roof remains a shadowy figure in the narrative (see the journalist and critic Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah’s Pulitzer Prize-winning profile for a more detailed look at his life and radicalization). He is not even named at first, referred to only as “a young white man, lean of frame.” Hawes takes an obsessive interest in his size and fragility, in fact; he is “a slim white man,” a “small man” who looked “so young and out of place” in the courtroom. There are countless references to his “scrawny” frame, his “slender hand” and “thin wrist.” It’s as if Hawes cannot reckon that monstrosity should present in such a package — and these sections want for self-scrutiny on her part, about which bodies might be automatically coded to her as harmless and innocent. Hawes says that she wanted to write as comprehensive an account as possible. She largely succeeds — if sacrificing, invariably, some depth for breadth. Still, she lands the book with moral force and great feeling, writing about the soil that could produce both the Emanuel Nine and a Dylann Roof."

Now President Trump is sealing up that wall from the other side. Google said on Monday that it would limit the software services it provides to Huawei, the telecommunications giant, after a White House order last week restricted the Chinese company’s access to American technology. Google’s software powers Huawei’s smartphones, and its apps come preloaded on the devices Huawei sells around the world. Depending on how the White House’s order is carried out, that could come to a stop. For Huawei, the big impact will be abroad, since Chinese customers already have limited access to Google’s services. Google’s move will have its biggest effect in places like Europe, where it has emerged as a big smartphone seller. Other companies will inevitably follow. In effect, the move puts pressure on Huawei’s international expansion dreams. If China and the United States have begun a technological Cold War, then the Huawei order can best be seen as the beginnings of a digital Iron Curtain. In this potential vision of the future of technology, China will continue to keep out much of the world. The United States and many other countries, goes this thinking, will in turn block Chinese technology. The tougher American stance is closing off many of the ways that the United States and China exchanged ideas and did business despite the strict Chinese censorship regime. Those closed doors could have profound effects not only on the business of technology, but also on how the world will use and understand the devices and services of the future.  Already, China’s censorship and tight control of its citizens’ digital lives have effectively isolated one-fifth of the world’s internet-using population, giving rise to a generation that doesn’t know what it means to Google something or to subscribe to a YouTube channel.  The aggressive new stance by the United States will only speed up that process, opening a potential window to a day when Chinese people can use only Chinese phones and gadgets powered by homegrown chips and software. All this is happening with a speed that has shocked many in China.  “The move by the Trump administration is much more comprehensive than many Chinese expected,” said Nicole Peng, an analyst at technology research firm Canalys. “It also came much earlier. Many people only realize now that it’s for real.” It is far from clear whether the Trump administration’s moves will truly isolate Huawei from the rest of the world. The White House has struggled to persuade other countries to stop buying Huawei’s telecommunications equipment, citing potential espionage concerns. (Huawei denies that it spies for the Chinese government.) Huawei has already developed its own chips and other capabilities, and has said that it has stockpiled equipment for a day when it would lose access to American know-how and equipment. The attack on Huawei is also taking place against the backdrop of a worsening trade war, making it one piece on a larger game board. Just as it did last year, when the White House relented on a similar order that crippled Huawei’s rival ZTE, the United States could lift its pressure on Huawei to ease tensions between Washington and Beijing. China has ways it could retaliate. On Monday, China’s state media reported that Xi Jinping, China’s top leader, visited a site that mines and processes rare earths, which are essential minerals for a number of manufacturers in low-carbon technologies. His visit was a none-too-subtle reminder that China has a commanding presence in rare earths and could shut off global supplies — something it has done once before.  The digital Iron Curtain has been long in the making. From its earliest days dealing with the internet, the Chinese government has squelched content it didn’t like. Today, the Chinese internet at first glance doesn’t look much like the one the rest of the world uses. It has different platforms, ideals and business strategies, all tended carefully by censors. But the wall was mostly one-sided. American chips and software power Chinese servers and mainframes. China has been a big revenue driver for Apple, Oracle, Intel, Qualcomm and other big names in tech. Much of this was by necessity, since China couldn’t make all this stuff itself, but it still gave American companies a role in the direction of the Chinese digital future. The ties go deeper. Many of the founders of China’s most successful technology companies were educated in the United States. American investors helped them get established, and some of those Chinese companies turned around and invested in American companies. Academics from the two countries regularly teamed up and swapped notes.  Now the United States, concerned about securing intellectual property, is working to block some of those channels. It has tightened limits on Chinese investment in American companies. Some Chinese students who focused on science and technology have had problems getting visas to the United States. Some Chinese scholars have had their American visas revoked over spying fears.  With the Huawei limits, the Trump administration cited safety. The Commerce Department announced last week that it had placed Huawei and its dozens of affiliates on a list of firms deemed a risk to national security. The listing will prevent Huawei from buying American parts and technologies without seeking United States government approval.  The executive order, issued after trade talks with China collapsed this month, could ripple through all parts of Huawei’s business. It has said American suppliers account for nearly one-fifth of its procurement spending. Even small parts could be crucial. Nobody wants to buy a high-end Huawei router that is only 95 percent complete. But in international expansion, companies like Google give Huawei a common platform for customers outside China. Its phones come loaded with Google Play, the app and media store, as well as popular apps like Gmail and YouTube. Its license to use Android gives Huawei access to security updates and new features.  Without Google’s cooperation, Huawei would have to come up with its own version of Android or use its own homegrown operating system. Many customers in places like Europe would rather not deal with that fuss. China has been trying to build its own operating systems over the past three decades but has not had much success. In China, many people see the American moves as a naked ploy to stop a rising Chinese competitor. The United States can’t beat Huawei’s innovation and moxie, goes this thinking, so it will use the power of government to keep a Chinese rival down.  Others in China point to the country’s own barriers against competitors as a strategy that was going to provoke retaliation sooner or later. At some point, the United States was bound to use reciprocity in dealing with a closed Chinese internet market. One popular blog post explained that reciprocity has been translated into “mutual benefit” in Chinese, which explains why many in China didn’t understand that the idea could be used in retaliation. Another popular blog post drives the point even more clearly.  “You’ve been opposing the U.S. for many years,” said the headline. “You should be long prepared that the U.S. will oppose you one day.”"

Google, Qualcomm and Broadcom are among the companies that have reportedly frozen their supply of components and software to the Chinese technology giant to comply with a crackdown by the Trump administration. • “Google has suspended business with Huawei that requires the transfer of hardware, software and technical services except those publicly available via open source licensing,” Reuters reported, citing unidentified sources. • “Chipmakers including Intel, Qualcomm, Xilinx and Broadcom have told their employees they will not supply Huawei till further notice,” Bloomberg added, also citing unnamed sources. The moves follow a Trump administration clampdown. The Commerce Department announced last week that U.S. companies would need special permission to sell some products to Huawei. It’s not yet clear how long or deep the crackdown will be. Some commentators have said that it could be a short-lived part of U.S. trade war posturing. But the administration has been vocal about its concerns over possible threats to national security, and Huawei has said that it was prepared for being frozen out. How the moves could hurt Huawei. Existing products would continue to receive Google updates, but future devices would have to use the open-source version of the operating system, without services like YouTube and Google Maps. The chip freeze-out means it might be forced to use its stockpile of U.S. components. “We can now expect China to redouble efforts to roll out a homegrown smartphone operating system, design its own chips, develop its own semiconductor technology (including design tools and manufacturing equipment), and implement its own technology standards,” Tim Culpan of Bloomberg Opinion writes. “This can only accelerate the process of creating a digital iron curtain that separates the world into two distinct, mutually exclusive technological spheres.” More: U.S. intelligence chiefs have warned American tech companies of the dangers of doing business in China. Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, is doing something similar. Anti-money laundering specialists at the German lender recommended in 2016 and 2017 that transactions involving Donald Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, be reported to a federal financial crimes watchdog, David Enrich of the NYT reports. Transactions set off automated alerts designed to detect illicit activity, Mr. Enrich writes, citing current and former bank employees. Compliance staffers then prepared reports to send to the Treasury Department. Executives rejected the recommendations, and the reports were never filed. The kinds of all-cash deals made by real estate developers like the Trump and Kushner families can prompt anti-money laundering reviews, and bank executives can choose not to report activity if they conclude employees’ concerns are unwarranted. But the decisions reflected Deutsche Bank’s lax approach to money laundering laws, former employees told Mr. Enrich. They saw the move as part of the lender’s tendency to protect relationships with lucrative clients. “It’s the D.B. way,” Tammy McFadden, a former Deutsche Bank anti-money laundering specialist who reviewed some of the transactions, told the NYT. “You present them with everything, and you give them a recommendation, and nothing happens.” Robert F. Smith stunned 396 young men graduating yesterday from Morehouse College, a historically black college in Atlanta, by announcing that he, America’s richest black man, would pay off all their student debt. “We’re going to put a little fuel in your bus,” Mr. Smith, the commencement speaker, told the crowd. He later said, “Let’s make sure every class has the same opportunity going forward, because we are enough to take care of our own community.” “This was a liberation gift, meaning this frees these young men from having to make their career decisions based on their debt,” David Thomas, the college president, told the NYT. Mr. Smith “had become increasingly concerned in recent years about the degree to which students leave college saddled with heavy debts, including many at Morehouse,” the NYT reported, citing a person familiar with his thinking. But details remain unsettled, including how students will demonstrate the amount of debt they have and how it will be paid off. Also unclear: the total amount Mr. Smith will contribute. Mr. Smith built his fortune, estimated at $5 billion, through a career as a Goldman Sachs banker and as founder of Vista Equity Partners, a tech investment firm whose returns are believed to be among the best in private equity. As of today, U.S. tariffs on metal imports from Mexico and Canada have been lifted, Ana Swanson of the NYT reports • That removes “a major irritant for two important allies that in exchange agreed to stop punishing American farmers with their own taxes on pork, cheese and milk.” • President Trump also “postponed a decision on whether to impose tariffs on automobiles imported from Europe, Japan and other countries for six months.” The U-turn is tied to the newly negotiated Nafta, called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. “Mr. Trump had described the tariffs as a source of leverage in negotiating a revision to that deal, which has yet to be ratified,” Ms. Swanson writes. “But both Republicans and Democrats had said they would not sign off on that deal until the White House removed metal tariffs on Canada and Mexico.” Together, “the actions remove the threat of an all-encompassing global trade war and allow Mr. Trump to focus on pushing China to agree to the United States’ trade terms, as well as pressuring Europe and Japan to reach a trade deal before the 2020 election,” Ms. Swanson writes. More: Big companies have tightened spending as trade fears intensify. Facebook says artificial intelligence is a solution to its toxic content problems. Mike Schroepfer, its chief technology officer, says it won’t solve everything — and the scale of the problem has made him cry, Cade Metz and Mike Isaac of the NYT report. • Mr. Schroepfer “is the person at Facebook leading the efforts to build the automated tools to sort through and erase the millions of such posts. But the task is Sisyphean, he acknowledged over the course of three interviews.” • “Every time Mr. Schroepfer and his more than 150 engineering specialists create A.I. solutions that flag and squelch noxious material, new and dubious posts that the A.I. systems have never seen before pop up — and are thus not caught.” • “In two of the interviews, he started with an optimistic message that A.I. could be the solution, before becoming emotional. At one point, he said coming to work had sometimes become a struggle. Each time, he choked up when discussing the scale of the issues that Facebook was confronting and his responsibilities in changing them.” • “I do think there’s an endgame here,” Mr. Schroepfer said, adding: “I don’t think it’s ‘everything’s solved,’ and we all pack up and go home.” Brian Rosenthal of the NYT takes a deep dive into how bankers and officials made money from the sale of New York City taxi medallions, even as lending turned predatory and Uber and Lyft devastated many drivers. What the bankers did: • “Between 2002 and 2014, the price of a medallion rose to more than $1 million from $200,000, even though city records showed that driver incomes barely changed.” • “The investigation found example after example of drivers trapped in exploitative loans, including hundreds who signed interest-only loans that required them to pay exorbitant fees, forfeit their legal rights and give up almost all their monthly income, indefinitely.”  What city officials did: • “For more than a decade, the agencies reduced oversight of the taxi trade, exempted it from regulations, subsidized its operations and promoted its practices, records and interviews showed.” • Under the Bloomberg and de Blasio administrations, New York City “made more than $855 million by selling taxi medallions and collecting taxes on private sales, according to the city.” • “When the medallion market collapsed, the government largely abandoned the drivers who bore the brunt of the crisis. Officials did not bail out borrowers or persuade banks to soften loan terms.” The series finale for “Game of Thrones” concluded a major TV phenomenon. But HBO has a plan to move on from its hit, Gerry Smith of Bloomberg reports. • HBO plans to increase its original programming 50 percent this year, “creating more chances for another blockbuster,” Mr. Smith writes. • Shows in the pipeline include adaptations of the graphic novel “Watchmen” as well as “His Dark Materials,” the series of fantasy novels by Philip Pullman. But “Game of Thrones” sets a high bar.  The penultimate episode drew 18.4 million viewers across all HBO platforms. “The finale was a mass live-viewing experience of the kind that is now almost unheard for serialized television — or almost any TV program that isn’t the Super Bowl,” John Jurgenson of the WSJ writes. Replicating that in the streaming era will be difficult. Mr. Smith points out that “about 500 scripted TV shows” are fighting for attention.

Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning, We’re covering the spread of Ebola in eastern Congo, an investigation of New York City’s taxi industry and the “Game of Thrones” finale. In the past two months, an Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo has become the second-largest ever recorded. More than 1,100 people have died, according to the World Health Organization, although aid groups say the death toll is far higher. After some early success, including a new vaccine, efforts to combat the epidemic have been hobbled by attacks on treatment centers and health workers, and by mistrust of the government and international medical experts.  When treatment centers were attacked and a doctor killed, front-line health workers suspended their work. Some aid groups have pulled personnel from areas where Ebola has hit hardest. Quotable: “The new protocol is that we just abandon the body,” said a member of one Ebola response team. “They will learn their lesson when they get sick.” Anti-money-laundering specialists at Deutsche Bank recommended in 2016 and 2017 that transactions connected to President Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, be reported to a federal financial crimes watchdog. But executives at the German bank, which has lent billions of dollars to the Trump and Kushner companies, never filed employees’ reports with the government. The employees said it was part of a pattern of executives rejecting reports to protect relationships with lucrative clients. How we know: Five current and former bank employees detailed the cases, which involved transactions that set off alerts in a computer system designed to detect illicit activity. At least some of those transactions involved money flowing back and forth overseas. (Red flags do not necessarily make the transactions improper: Real estate developers like Mr. Trump and Mr. Kushner sometimes do large, all-cash deals, including with people outside the U.S.) Response: A spokeswoman for the Trump Organization said the family businesses had “no knowledge of any ‘flagged’ transactions with Deutsche Bank.” Background: Deutsche Bank was the only mainstream financial institution that remained consistently willing to do business with Mr. Trump. That relationship is under investigation, and the president has sued to block the bank from complying with congressional subpoenas. The Environmental Protection Agency plans to adopt a method for projecting the health risks of air pollution that would lower its estimate of premature deaths under a proposed rule on emissions from coal plants. The methodology, which five current or former agency officials described to The Times, could be used by the Trump administration to defend further rollbacks of air pollution rules. It’s not unusual for an administration to use accounting changes to make its decisions look better, but experts said the new method has never been peer-reviewed and is not scientifically sound. Response: William Wehrun, the E.P.A. air quality chief, said in an interview that the new method would be part of the agency’s final analysis of the Affordable Clean Energy rule, which is expected next month. Australia, which has a growing ethnic Chinese population and strong economic ties to China, has become a case study in Beijing’s attempts to steer debate and influence policy inside a democratic trading partner. Representatives of Beijing routinely lobby Australian politicians, and China and its supporters have sought to suppress criticism in the Australian news media. Why it matters: Many countries face the same challenge from China, which is pushing its authoritarian agenda around the world. Catch up: Scott Morrison, Australia’s conservative prime minister, scored a surprise victory in federal elections over the weekend, propelled by a populist wave resembling the force that has upended politics in the U.S., Britain and beyond. Over the past year, a spate of suicides by taxi drivers in New York City has highlighted the overwhelming debt of those with medallions, the coveted permit for yellow cab ownership. Officials have blamed competition from ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft. But a Times investigation found that a few industry leaders artificially inflated the price of taxi medallions, creating a bubble that eventually burst.  Middle East peace plan: President Trump and Jared Kushner announced on Sunday that the U.S. would hold an “economic workshop” in Bahrain next month, hoping that investment and financial incentives would encourage the Palestinians and other Arabs to resolve the conflict with Israel. India’s election: According to exit polls, Prime Minister Narendra Modi appeared headed for re-election after more than five weeks of parliamentary voting. Official results are expected on Thursday. Test of populism in Europe: Many far-right leaders see this week’s elections for the European Parliament as a chance to expand their power in Brussels. Snapshot: Above, graduates of Morehouse College in Atlanta reacted with joy on Sunday after their commencement speaker, the billionaire Robert Smith, announced that his family would pay off the student debt of the entire graduating class of 396 students.  Repeat P.G.A. champion: Brooks Koepka defended his title at the P.G.A. Championship, becoming the first man to hold back-to-back titles in two major tournaments simultaneously. (He has also won the past two U.S. Opens.) “Game of Thrones”: The series is over, but the arguments are just beginning. Find out who rules and who rests in peace in our recap of Sunday’s finale.

Watch: Recent movie trailers like “Maleficent: Mistress of Evil” and “Always Be My Maybe” seem to have something for everyone. Listen: Slipknot remains a wildly popular cult act, and the band has released new music: “Unsainted” is the lead single from “We Are Not Your Kind,” which will be released in August.

And next time you’re doing laundry, spice up your folding techniques. Japan released new quarterly growth data today. In a surprise, the economy expanded, despite sluggishness in China. The country has enjoyed several years of modest growth, but China’s slowdown is dragging Japanese export figures down. The trade war between Washington and Beijing could make things worse. In the 1980s, Japan was in China’s place: an upstart powerhouse vying with the U.S. to be the world’s largest economy.

Japan just has to keep him happy. Mr. Trump is set to arrive in Tokyo on Saturday to meet the new emperor, Naruhito.

Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning, We start today with populism in the European Parliament elections, more about Deutsche Bank and the end of “Game of Thrones.”  The E.U.’s far-right populists are banding together for a frontal assault on the political establishment in this week’s elections for the European Parliament.  Opinion polls suggest they could win up to 180 seats.  The races are seen as the best barometer of just how angry and alienated Europe really is — and just how broadly populists of various stripes can break through after years of gaining political strength. As the populists are playing to anger and nationalism, mainstream leaders are trying to sell their apathetic voters on maintaining the course. Reality: Populists are not expected to win the biggest number of the Parliament’s 751 seats, let alone a majority. Still, analysts predict a major electoral breakthrough that is certain to disrupt European politics. A big question is whether the varied populists, assuming they win a sizable number of seats, can coalesce into a powerful coalition.  Context: The recent scandal in Austria, which forced the resignation of the far-right Freedom Party vice chancellor and the collapse of the government on Saturday, may also damage the populist surge, reminding voters of how close many of these parties are to Russia. Anti-money-laundering specialists at the German bank recommended in 2016 and 2017 that transactions connected to President Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, be reported to a federal financial crimes watchdog. But executives ignored the employees. While international real estate deals sometimes raise money-laundering concerns, employees saw the bank’s inaction as part of a pattern of rejecting valid reports to protect relationships with lucrative clients. How we know: Five current and former bank employees detailed the cases. The flagged transactions set off alerts in a computer system designed to detect illicit activity. At least some involved money flowing between overseas entities and individuals, including Russians. Response: A spokeswoman for the Trump Organization said the family businesses had “no knowledge of any ‘flagged’ transactions with Deutsche Bank.” Reminder: Deutsche Bank was the only mainstream financial institution that remained consistently willing to do business with Mr. Trump despite the repeated red flags. The relationship between the president and the bank is under investigation, and he has sued to block the bank from complying with congressional subpoenas. President Alexander Van der Bellen said the country had “exact rules and procedures” to handle the government collapse that ensued after the emergence of a video showing the far-right vice chancellor promising favors to a woman who claimed to be a Russian investor. “I urge there to be new elections in September, if possible at the beginning of the month,” Mr. Van der Bellen said after meeting with Chancellor Sebastian Kurz on Sunday.  The video: The German newsmagazine Der Spiegel and the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung released a video on Friday that depicted a conversation between a woman who said she was the niece of a Russian oligarch and Vice Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache. After the woman offered to invest 250 million euros, or about $280 million, in Austria, Mr. Strache promised infrastructure contracts. It was filmed months before the 2017 election, in which Mr. Kurz led his party to victory. The meeting appeared to be a setup. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, one of the most divisive leaders India has produced in decades, appears headed for a second term, according to exit polls released shortly after the marathon election wrapped up on Sunday. More than half a dozen polls suggest that Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party will pick up at least 280 of the 545 seats in the lower house of Parliament — well past the 272 seats needed to form a government on its own. Exit polls in India have a patchy track record. But if the official results, due Thursday, back them up, it would appear that Mr. Modi has been unscathed by economic distress and sectarian tensions, giving him a strong hand in the next term. “One thing we know for sure is that Modi remains incredibly popular despite everything that’s happened in the last five years,” said Milan Vaishnav, a South Asia expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “Nothing really sticks to him.” Critics worry that victory will embolden Mr. Modi to assert the Hindu nationalist policies that his party campaigned on, placing India squarely within a global shift to the right.

Switzerland: Voters agreed to tighten the country’s gun laws to reach parity with E.U. antiterrorism legislation that came into force following attacks in Paris and elsewhere.  Britain: One of the country’s most prolific extremist networks, Al Muhajiroun, which was implicated in the London bombings of 2005, appears to be regrouping as a founder, Anjem Choudary, and other members are being released from detention. Ebola: An outbreak in eastern Congo — the second-largest ever recorded — is escalating in part because locals don’t trust health workers and government officials. Venezuela: Economists said the country, once Latin America’s richest, has suffered the worst economic collapse outside of war in at least 45 years. Ukraine: Though sexual abuse in the army is widespread, Ukrainian rights groups say, it is typically swept under the rug in a society reluctant to criticize soldiers during a war. At War: The Times’s At War section will publish five dispatches over 2019 — each framed as a glimpse into the lives of Syrian family members as they learn to adjust to life in Europe and try to move beyond the label of “war refugee.” Snapshot: Duncan Laurence, representing the Netherlands, won Eurovision, the unapologetically kitschy singing contest that in the past had catapulted acts like Abba and Celine Dion to international fame. This year’s competition included 41 countries and took place in Tel Aviv, Israel, against a backdrop of intense political tensions in Gaza. Elba: Hotels on the idyllic Italian island are offering tourists refunds for rainy days during their trips. Guests receive a refund for one night if it rains for more than two hours between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m.  Human rights: Taiwan became the first country in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage, a step that human rights activists hope will inspire the rest of the region, where gay rights have lagged. “Game of Thrones”: The finale is over, but the arguments about it are just starting. Find out who rules and who rests in peace in our recap. What we’re reading: This guide from The Washington Post, recommended by Anna Holland, a London-based editor. “I loved seeing where ambassadors go to eat in Washington when they miss home,” she writes. “I left New Mexico nearly 15 years ago, but my hunt for proper enchiladas (stacked, with red chile and a fried egg) continues.”  Cook: Thai-style cucumber salad balances big flavors and textures with snappy cucumbers, velvety peanut sauce, crunchy cilantro-peanut topping and zingy chile oil.

Go: Like so many good ideas, the Every Woman Biennial was born of a joke. Now it’s in its third edition, displaying the work of over 600 female and nonbinary artists.

The threat of an all-out global trade war has been quelled, at least for now. President Trump delayed a decision on whether to impose tariffs on automobiles imported from Europe, Japan and other countries, while also reaching agreements with Canada and Mexico to lift import tariffs on metals. Above, a shipment terminal in Fukuoka, Japan. Together, the actions allow Mr. Trump to focus on pushing China to agree to U.S. trade terms, as well as pressure Europe and Japan to reach a trade deal before the 2020 election. Compounding trade war tensions are fears that the U.S. could be on the brink of conflict with Iran. Our national security correspondent breaks down the president’s strategic goals. Our news quiz is on hiatus this week. Here’s the front page of our Sunday paper, the Sunday Review from Opinion and our crossword puzzles. ____ 2. The cultural momentum of the anti-abortion movement has taken over, and it shows no signs of slowing. Last week, Alabama’s governor signed a law nearly banning the procedure, and Missouri became the latest state to prohibit abortion as soon as a fetal heartbeat is detected. The measures are part of a sustained effort by a network of disparate activists, each with their own strategy honed over decades of work. Above, a group of abortion rights advocates at the Missouri State Capitol. The Alabama bill was purposefully crafted to be a direct challenge to Roe v. Wade. But our Supreme Court reporter says that the court is likely to chip away at smaller bills first. As soon as Monday, the court could announce whether it will hear challenges to three provisions of Indiana abortion laws. ____ 3. Australia’s conservative prime minister, Scott Morrison, secured a surprise election victory, another swell in a global wave of populist fervor. The win stunned election analysts, and signaled Australians’ unwillingness to bet on a new leader at a time when the economy has not suffered a recession in nearly 28 years. Separately, a far-right official in Austria resigned over a video that raised questions about Russian influence in that country. Now the chancellor is calling for snap elections. And looking ahead, the far-right populists of the E.U. are banding together for a frontal assault on the political establishment in this week’s elections for the European Parliament. ____ 4. From the Australian election to the 2020 U.S. election. Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, above left, and Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana announced their presidential bids last week. We also took a look at how Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont infused left-wing activism into local politics and how Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York is trying to jumpstart her campaign. America’s culture wars will be at the heart of the 2020 election. Our political reporters explain how that might pan out for both parties. Lastly, do you love town halls? Join our reporters on Sunday at 7 p.m. Eastern time, on the NYTimes app or at NYTimes.com, as our reporters analyze an appearance by Pete Buttigieg on Fox News. ____ 5. San Francisco banned city agencies from using facial recognition technology, becoming the first major American city to block a tool that many police forces are turning to. But many police departments say the technology is used no differently from DNA databases or other crime-fighting tools. It has been used to arrest men accused of child sex abuse and has helped nab a trio of jewel thief suspects, among other cases we looked at. Separately, Facebook has heralded artificial intelligence as a solution to its toxic content problems. We talked to its chief technology officer, who says artifical intelligence won’t solve everything. ____ 6. Heroin is disappearing up and down the Eastern Seaboard. In its place: fentanyl. The rise of the more potent synthetic drug has put a generation of older users, like William Glen Miller Sr., above, who had managed their addiction, at far greater risk of overdose. Federal data shows that the rate of overdose deaths involving fentanyl increased nearly 54 percent in 2017 for people ages 55 to 64 — more than for any other age group. The reason fentanyl is everywhere is economic: It is much cheaper to produce and distribute than heroin. ____ 7. Reckless loans have devastated a generation of New York taxi drivers. After a spate of suicides revealed the financial plight of taxi drivers, officials blamed Uber and Lyft. But a two-part New York Times investigation shows the roots of the crisis go far deeper. Over a decade, a handful of powerful industry leaders steadily drove up the price of taxi medallions, creating a bubble that eventually burst. They channeled thousands of drivers into the deceptive loan scheme and extracted hundreds of millions of dollars. And agencies at every level of government did little to help taxi drivers as they became crushed under overwhelming debt. ____ 8. “Game of Thrones” is going out fighting. So will its audience. The arguments over HBO’s dark fantasy made it the signature show of an era when no one agrees on anything, our TV critic writes ahead of tonight’s series finale. We want to see how you celebrate the series finale — you can submit your photos here. Who will win the Iron Throne? Your guess, or bet, is as good as anyone’s. There has been a flurry of offshore and European wagering on the finale of the hit show, but betting on a scripted series has its drawbacks. Here are some theories on the series. ____ 9. And now for a touch of wanderlust. For its travel issue, T Magazine asked writers to reveal a little-known aspect, story or place of ancient culture. The countries visited in the issue — including Morocco, above, India and Greece — are home to some of the oldest cultures in history. Separately, we also paid a visit to Axminster Carpets, which was founded in 1755 and produces plush floor coverings for Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle and other prestigious addresses. But thanks to social media, its best-known client is a chain of cut-price bars. ____ 10. Finally, here are some of our Best Weekend Reads.

In a letter to congressional leaders dated Friday, the administration said the extra money would be needed on top of $2.9 billion it had already requested to deal with the growing influx of migrant children. The immigration rate has already surpassed the projections used to justify that request, which was sent on May 1. “Since then, the situation has continued to deteriorate and is exceeding the previous high-end estimate,” Russell T. Vought, the acting director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, wrote in the letter to lawmakers. The rising demands “will exhaust amounts currently available to fund services that involve the safety of human life, protection of property and the immediate welfare of individuals.” The rising costs underscored that while the president in his public speeches and rallies focuses on the danger of criminals entering the country, the immediate crisis at the border is a humanitarian one — caring for the sick, housing children, holding families in temporary detention facilities and paying for extra asylum screeners. The government is so overwhelmed that in recent days it began flying hundreds of migrants from South Texas to holding cells in California. Border authorities detained 109,144 migrants at the southwest border in April, including at its legal ports of entry, the highest total since 2007. The warning about increasing expenditures comes as the administration and Congress struggle to push through an emergency disaster relief spending bill that could be the vehicle for more money for the border situation. President Trump has resisted efforts to provide extra money for Puerto Rico, which is struggling to recover from twin hurricanes in 2017, arguing with inaccurate numbers that it has already gotten enough. Just a week ago, the House passed legislation providing $19.1 billion in relief for communities hit by various natural disasters and farmers affected by the president’s trade war, with 34 Republicans joining the Democratic majority. Mr. Trump came out against the bill, but Senate Republicans and Democrats have reported progress in recent days toward a compromise. In a document accompanying Mr. Vought’s letter on Friday, the administration said the number of unaccompanied minors referred to the Department of Health and Human Services for care has increased by more than 57 percent over this time last year. The letter was previously reported by Politico. The administration has already reallocated nearly $400 million to respond and “curtailed expenditures not essential to the health and safety” of the children. It requested the $2.9 billion previously to increase shelter capacity to 23,600 beds. If the flow does not significantly exceed the department’s previous worst-case scenario, then the $2.9 billion should be enough, Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, wrote in a separate letter accompanying Mr. Vought’s. But he added that he worried the numbers would continue to grow and require even more money. The $2.9 billion was part of an overall package of $4.5 billion sought by the administration on May 1 for border spending, including expenses for security personnel, additional detention beds, and operations combating human smuggling and trafficking. While none of that money would go to building Mr. Trump’s border wall, Democrats objected to some planned expenditures like detention beds that they said would enable the president to detain more undocumented immigrants. But they signaled support for the $2.9 billion for care of children."

I’m filling in this week for Charlotte, who’s off tallying her losses from the recent stock market dive. Here’s what you need to know in business news.  MAY 12-18 Now you definitely don’t. At least, not if you’re an artificially intelligent machine in San Francisco. The city’s Board of Supervisors voted on Tuesday to prohibit the use of facial recognition technology within city limits. It’s a somewhat symbolic move: The police there don’t currently use the stuff, and the places where it is in use — seaports and airports — are under federal jurisdiction and therefore unaffected by the new regulation.  The major television networks tried to sell their fall advertising slots in an annual pageant known as the upfronts. In a week of star-studded presentations, skits and boozy mingling, representatives of major advertisers flocked to New York to see what the networks have in store. Even though traditional TV is losing market share and relevance to newer streaming services, it remains one of the few places where advertisers can reach millions of people in real time. The Trump administration has called Huawei a tool for Beijing’s espionage, and now, Washington has barred American companies from doing business with the Chinese telecom giant. That means component makers like Broadcom, Intel and Qualcomm will no longer be able to sell their parts to Huawei, and Google’s Android operating system might be pulled from Huawei’s mobile phones.  may 19-25 Stocks will continue to be a barometer for anxiety around President Trump’s worsening trade war with China. The two sides, which had appeared headed for a deal, are once again far apart, and it’s extremely unclear how they can de-escalate. The next juncture for Mr. Trump and China’s leader, Xi Jinping, to find common ground could be a scheduled meeting of Group of 20 leaders in Japan in June.  Compounding the market jitters are fears that the United States could be on the brink of conflict with Iran. Mr. Trump has sought to signal that he doesn’t want war, even as his administration reviews its plans for just such an event. Analysts will parse the situation this week at the International Petroleum Summit in Houston, and forecast whether the tensions will translate into higher oil prices. With Boeing’s 737 Max jets still grounded after two fatal crashes, the Federal Aviation Administration will host a gathering of air regulators from around the world in Dallas on Thursday. The goal: restore their confidence in both Boeing and the agency. Last week, the acting administrator of the F.A.A. defended the company on Capitol Hill, but safety experts remain unconvinced the jets in question are ready to return to the skies. The landmark Trans World Airlines terminal at Kennedy International Airport reopened as the lobby of a fancy new hotel, giving travelers a visitable monument to the 1960s — the golden age of air travel.

Here’s the sign-up.] Natalie Kitroeff, a business reporter at The New York Times, guest-hosted two episodes of “The Daily” this week. In a Slack conversation, I asked her about her path to hosting. Natalie Kitroeff: O.K.! I started here at The Times as an assistant, left and worked at Bloomberg and then The L.A. Times, and then came back here to cover the industrial economy. Here I am. Can I ask you questions or no? Michael Barbaro: Not really. Who were you an assistant to? Natalie: I was an assistant to Nick Kristof and Charles Blow. Michael: Oh, wow. I had no idea. So you spent time in our Opinion department with the columnists. Natalie: I did. I was mainly a fact-checker. Michael: What’s your favorite story of checking facts for Nick and Charles? Natalie: Honestly, the most hilarious moments did not involve fact-checking. They involved being Nick Kristof’s travel planner. I had to file expenses for him. Michael: That man travels. And travels. Natalie: He would go places and bring back, like, a receipt on a piece of bark. It was hard to file. Then I would need to interface with all these governments that he had recently insulted in a column, to try to get him a visa. Michael: As in, hi, it’s Natalie. I know you are really mad at Nick, but he’d like your permission to enter your country. Natalie: Exactly. He just called out your dictatorship, but, um, he’s on his way! Michael: So you learn the art of persuasion. Natalie: Yes. And diplomacy. Also truly learned that if you are straightforward and honest with people, they will respect you. Michael: Wise words. Natalie: Even if they don’t necessarily adore hearing from you. Michael: So that naturally leads you to want to report yourself? Natalie: Yeah, exactly. I caught the bug. Fact-checking is grueling work, but it is also the core of what we do. I liked the precision of it. Michael: I very much remember your first “Daily” episode, a really eye-opening investigation into pregnancy discrimination, because we all decided immediately that we wanted you back on ASAP, which is what happened. Natalie: Oh, that’s nice. Michael: And now, from guest … to guest host. How are you feeling about that? Natalie: Oof. It’s not as easy as impersonating Michael in my living room? Michael: Hah. Natalie: No, but seriously, it isn’t easy. One of the things about newspaper reporting that I always try to remember is that there is this imbalance built into it — the things I say don’t generally end up in an article, whereas the things people say to me do. But then, on “The Daily,” you, as the reporter, are right there in it. Every gasp, every giggle, every ... hmmmm. Michael: Hmmm. Do you think there are advantages to that? Having a reporter (you) be so present in the conversation? Natalie: The really nice thing is that there are these moments in reporting that never, ever make it into the newspaper — moments of levity in a tough call, little tangents that would never make it into the lead of a news story, but are just so deeply a part of what we do. It’s nice to feel like we can show people that we are humans, just talking to other humans, trying to figure things out. Michael: Entirely. There’s also just the transparency of hearing both sides of a conversation. Not just one side. Natalie: Yes! I think that is really important, especially now. With the whole fake news meme. Michael: What’s been the most fun about it? Natalie: The most fun — being in the studio with the producers or with you, hearing something incredible in the middle of an interview, and looking up at the producers and making eye contact and just being like, YES! That’s amazing! Michael: Give me an example. Natalie: Oh, well, when we were talking with Eldon, there was a moment in the middle of the interview where he brought up something that we hadn’t really thought about in planning the interview. He pipes up with this smart, thoughtful description of what he’s worried about. It was more than just the immediate questions of survival — will the trade war kill his farm? — but something much bigger and more diffuse. Will the trade war cause long-term damage to the trading relationships that the U.S. agriculture industry has built up over decades? I looked up at Paige, one of the producers, in that moment, and just shook my head, truly in wonder. Like, wow, this man needs a podcast! Michael: The Eldon Show. He’s one of those guests we end up talking about for years. Like, remember Eldon? Why don’t we just call back Eldon and make that an episode? Natalie: I get that. Michael: O.K., so, I have to run into a script planning session. But I want to leave with a final question and a thought. You possess this rare combination of intelligence, kindness, authority and wittiness. We like you. Will you agree to host more episodes? Natalie: Hmmm. Just kidding. Obviously, yes. Please. Whenever. :slightly_smiling_face: Michael: Wonderful! We’ll be in touch. Natalie: I’m just nervous the world will resist a Barbaro-free episode. Anyway, we can talk about that neurosis later. Byeee!!! Michael: They crave something new. Talk to Natalie on Twitter: @nataliekitro. And Michael: @mikiebarb. Many of you wondered why we ended Tuesday’s episode about Representative Rashida Tlaib with a quote from President Trump that condemned her statements about the Holocaust and claimed she dislikes Jewish people. Why did we give him the last word? Several factors went into that decision: 1. The president’s quote appeared in what we call the “back announce,” the final words Michael reads in a segment that update you on what’s happened since we recorded an interview. Back announces are, by design, almost always chronological. Events are laid out in the order they happened. In this case, the president’s tweet was sent a day after Tlaib decried her critics for “twisting and turning my words.” It was the last development. 2. We believed that Tlaib’s claim that her words were being taken out of context, juxtaposed with a scolding presidential tweet that offered no context whatsoever, was revealing. 3. Donald Trump is the president. His words and opinions matter. In an episode in which we devoted 30 minutes to having Tlaib tell her story and frame her views, we felt comfortable including the words of one of her most vocal critics: the president of the United States. Who: Marc Georges, an editor for “The Daily” What: “Nerdette Recaps Game of Thrones with Peter Sagal” The cultural colossus that is “Game of Thrones” will come to an end this weekend. After eight years of political intrigue, zombie fights and dragon fire, we’ll finally learn who will sit on the Iron Throne — for now, at least. I’ve been watching the show since the beginning and have been rabidly seeking all the extra G.o.T. content I can find. One of my favorite podcasts that covers the series is “Nerdette Recaps Game of Thrones with Peter Sagal.” Yes, that Peter Sagal, from NPR’s “Wait Wait … Don’t Tell Me!” Hosts Greta Johnsen and Tricia Bobeda, along with Peter, have great chemistry on the mic, and the best thing about their podcast is that it doesn’t turn into a love fest for G.o.T. The trio take the TV show seriously, and they honestly critique what worked and what didn’t. It’s a fun hang, and every week I find myself both laughing and nodding along to the crew. Iran is back on a “collision course” with the U.S., and that may be part of national security adviser John Bolton’s plan. Mark Landler explains. “Look how I turned out. I turned out pretty tough.” Representative Rashida Tlaib, who’s at the center of a new political storm over her comments about Israel, tells us how her upbringing in an immigrant Palestinian family helped shape her political outlook. In the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China, much more is at stake than tariffs. “For significant numbers of people, national pride and dignity is on the line,” Peter Goodman says. We talked to a farmer in Illinois and a truck manufacturer in Iowa, both supporters of President Trump, who’ve found themselves caught in the middle of the trade war. Alabama passed a law banning nearly all abortions. The man who wrote the law knew it was unconstitutional, and did it anyway. We asked him why.

The global trade war had a momentary reprieve. President Trump delayed a decision on auto tariffs, taking a step back from opening another front in the continuing conflict. He set a tight six-month deadline for the U.S. to reach agreements for automobiles imported from Europe, Japan and other countries. Above, BMWs at Columbus Terminal in Charleston, S.C. The delay came as the White House reached agreements with Canada and Mexico to lift import tariffs on metals after a yearlong standoff. Separately, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin rejected a House subpoena to hand over Mr. Trump’s tax returns, likely the last step before the matter heads to the courts. _____ 2. Venezuela’s fall is the largest economic collapse outside of war in decades, economists say. The crumbling economy has now outpaced the fall of the Soviet Union, Cuba’s unraveling in the 1990s and Zimbabwe’s collapse under Robert Mugabe. Corruption and misguided policies of President Nicolás Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, have now brought the country to its knees. Above, men searched for salvageable items in Maracaibo. The Times is launching a series in which we revisit major news events to see if promises made by those in power were kept. First up: Colombia’s peace deal. And in other international news, lawmakers in Taiwan have voted to legalize same-sex marriage, a first for Asia, a region where gay rights have lagged. _____ 3. Low-income college students are being taxed like trust-fund babies because of a little-noticed provision in President Trump’s new tax law. Now, higher-education leaders want Congress to fix it. Students with large financial aid packages are finding their non-tuition assistance taxed by as much as 37 percent, even if their family income tax rates are lower. Republicans say they had not anticipated the tax hike on low-income scholarship winners, and that they are working as quickly as possible to address the issue. Above, Queens College in New York. Separately, the House passed sweeping legislation that would prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. The Trump administration opposes the measure. _____ 4. Missouri lawmakers passed a bill criminalizing abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected, without exception for cases of rape or incest. Four other states have passed similar laws this year. Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, is expected to sign it into law, although other so-called heartbeat bills have been suspended in court challenges. If enacted, doctors who break the law would be prosecuted and could receive prison sentences of five to 15 years. Above, abortion rights advocates at the state capitol in Jefferson City. In Alabama, which passed the country’s most restrictive law this week, opposition to the procedure runs deep. A majority of women in the state oppose abortion, and for many of them, the ban was a triumph. _____ 5. Unions are rethinking how they balance their responsibilities in sexual harassment cases. The most difficult conflicts arise when one union member accuses another of harassment. Such is the case for Amar Ramasar, above, a New York City Ballet dancer who was fired for sharing sexually explicit photos of a dancer with a colleague. An arbitrator ordered he be reinstated. Separately, an Ohio State team doctor sexually abused at least 177 men over decades and officials knew about the actions for years, a university report found. The university said that Richard Strauss, who committed suicide in 2005, groped students under the guise of providing medical treatment. _____ 6. “I serve as a steppingstone for everything else that is going to come to the Citadel.” For most of its 176-year history, the military college in South Carolina did not admit undergraduate women. That changed in 1995. But it wasn’t until last year that the school appointed its first female regimental commander, Sarah Zorn. As the head of the student body, Ms. Zorn led the corps’ five battalions and 21 companies, some 2,400 cadets. Our photographer followed Ms. Zorn over the last year. _____ 7. We have news on the obesity front. A new study suggests intervening early in cases of extreme obesity may help. Researchers followed 161 teenagers and 369 adults for five years after weight-loss surgery and found that teenagers actually fared better than adults. In recent years, many nutrition experts have linked the obesity epidemic to the spread of ultra-processed foods. New research provides strong evidence that these foods not only tend to make people eat more, but may result in dramatic and rapid weight gain. _____ 8. Hope is slipping away from the Portland Trailblazers. The Blazers are staring at a 2-0 deficit, which means that they would need to win four of their next five games against the Golden State Warriors. The Blazers have shown their toughness in the playoffs, our basketball reporter writes, but the Warriors’s will to win seems as strong as ever. Game 3 is Saturday in Portland. Back on the golf course: Tiger Woods has reclaimed golf’s spotlight heading into the P.G.A. Championship this weekend, but his stardom has not produced a diverse array of stars, which some had predicted. _____ 9. The sculptor Jeff Koons has long been a lightning rod in the art world. Our art critic says it’s time to stop hating him. Earlier this week, “The Rabbit” by Mr. Koons sold for $91.1 million, including fees, smashing the record at auction for a work by a living artist. Roberta Smith offers a defense of his work — and writes why his work continues to speak to us. Above, the artist and sculpture in February. We also have a review of “Boom” by Michael Shnayerson, a dishy look at the art world’s most powerful gallerists — including Larry Gagosian, Mr. Koons’s dealer — about how artworks became multimillion-dollar commodities. _____ 10. And lastly, saying goodbye to a beloved feline. Grumpy Cat, the ubiquitous internet celebrity know for her permanent expression of discontent, died this week at the age of 7. The announcement of the cat’s death was one of the best-read stories on our site today. Many cats have had moments of mini-fame on the internet, but few, if any, have had the reach and staying power of Grumpy Cat, whose actual name was Tardar Sauce. She even appeared in a Lifetime movie, above. Have cheerful weekend. _____ Correction: An earlier version of this briefing incorrectly referred to the location of BMWs in a photo caption.

53,ANA SWANSON,United States Expected to Lift Metal Tariffs on Canada and Mexico,"A steel maker in Finland. The Trump administration is expected to lift tariffs on metals imported from Canada and Mexico, but the move does not guarantee passage of a new trade deal.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/17/business/tariffs-metals-canada-mexico.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/17/business/17DC-STEELTARIFFS1/17DC-STEELTARIFFS1-facebookJumbo.jpg,5/17/19 16:29,"The rollback of metal tariffs would likely result in Canada and Mexico lifting the retaliatory levies that they have placed on American businesses, easing some of the pressure of the presidents trade war. Canada and Mexico put taxes on a variety of American g… [+1259 chars]",the-new-york-times,The New York Times,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration reached an agreement with Canada and Mexico to lift tariffs on metal imports, resolving a yearlong standoff that inflamed North Atlantic tensions and complicated efforts to ratify a revised trade deal. “I’m pleased to announce we’ve just reached agreement with Canada and Mexico,” President Trump said on Friday. “We’ll be selling our product into those countries without the imposition of tariffs.” As part of the agreement, both Mexico and Canada agreed to lift retaliatory tariffs on American products. Instead of tariffs, the nations would set up a system for monitoring and enforcement in case of import surges into the United States. In a statement on Friday afternoon, the United States trade representative said that the metal tariffs would be removed and that both Mexico and Canada “had agreed on the removal of all retaliatory tariffs imposed on American goods by those countries.” The Mexican government also said that it had reached an agreement with the United States to lift the steel and aluminum tariffs. In a statement issued by the office of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the government said that there would be no quotas. “Tariff-free trade will be restored in these products,” the statement said. For its part, Mexico said that it would lift the retaliatory tariffs that it had imposed. Both countries agreed to take measures to avoid dumping and to establish a process to monitor steel and aluminum trade between the two countries. “Mexico reached a highly satisfying agreement with the United States,” the statement said. Speaking from Stelco, one of the two major producers in Canada’s steel-making epicenter of Hamilton, Ontario, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada said on Friday that the deal was “pure good news.” Mr. Trudeau, appearing jubilant, signaled that the lifting of the tariffs could help clear the way for the ratification of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement reached late last year. “We are very optimistic we will be able to move forward in coming weeks,” he said, adding the deal was “a huge step forward.” The prime minister said that the deal stemmed from steady conversations with the United States, including Mr. Trump, and that both sides agreed that the tariffs were “harming workers and consumers on both sides of the border.” In recent weeks, the pressure on Mr. Trump to reach an accord with Canada and Mexico began to outweigh his affection for the tariffs. According to a congressional aide who has been involved in the talks among the three countries, the White House was growing increasingly sensitive to pressure from Republicans in rural states, whose farmers have been suffering from retaliation that diminished their access to sell in neighboring markets. Their problems were compounded when talks with China broke down this month, this person said, and ultimately Mr. Trump decided that he needed a victory on trade. The decision to ease the 25 percent tariffs on steel and 10 percent tariffs on aluminum came as the White House also announced a six-month delay in determining whether to impose levies on foreign automobiles. That extension delivers a temporary reprieve to global automakers and auto suppliers, which had been bracing for punishing tariffs of up to 25 percent. But it sets up a tight deadline for the president and his advisers to reach trade deals with Japan, Europe and potentially other countries. Farmers, ranchers and business groups had been pushing to lift the metal tariffs, to encourage Canada and Mexico to remove the tariffs they have placed on American products in return. Canadian and Mexican levies on products like pork, cheese and milk have especially hurt American farmers who are already smarting from Mr. Trump’s trade conflicts with China and Europe. The agreement is likely to help the administration focus on the other trade fights it is waging, most notably fractious negotiations with China, which nearly collapsed last week. And it will remove one obstacle to the passage of the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement in Congress. The United States, Canada and Mexico signed that trade deal, the successor to the North American Free Trade Agreement, in November. The pact still needs to be ratified by legislatures in all three countries. American lawmakers of both parties, as well as Canada and Mexico, had insisted that tariffs on steel and aluminum must be lifted before votes would be held. Lawmakers have argued that the tariffs, while aimed at other countries, hurt American companies and consumers by raising prices for products that use imported steel and aluminum. Even with an agreement to resolve metal tariffs, the North American pact still faces potential opposition from congressional Democrats. They have criticized its labor and environmental protections as insufficiently weak, and said that its protections for drug companies may undermine their efforts to make health care more affordable. Canada, like Mexico, has repeatedly said it would not ratify the new North American Free Trade Agreement, which Mr. Trump considers one of his signature economic achievements, unless the metal tariffs were lifted. Canada has argued that the tariffs undermined both countries’ economies and were particularly counterproductive given the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement reached last year. “Certainly, for the ratification of the U.S.M.C.A., it’s a step forward,” said Patrick Leblond, a senior fellow at the Center for International Governance Innovation, a think tank. In its announcement on Friday, Canada said that the two countries would set up measures to block imports of metals that are unfairly subsidized or sold at below-market prices. In the event of a surge in imported products, the countries would carry out consultations, and if those were not successful, the governments could impose a tariff on the individual product of 25 percent for steel and 10 percent for aluminum, it said. After Mr. Trump imposed the metals tariffs last June, the move drew anger, bemusement and disappointment in the metals industry and across the political spectrum in Canada. Canadians were irate that Mr. Trump appeared intent on punishing Canada, a major trading partner and traditionally one of its most ardent allies. Backed by all three of Canada’s three major political parties, the Canadian government retaliated with import duties on $12.6 billion of American products, including ballpoint pens and industrial pipes. The White House’s justification of the tariffs by citing national security drew particular scorn in Canada, where many were already reeling from Mr. Trump’s bullying and mocking of Mr. Trudeau and his trade policies. Some called for boycotts of American products and avoiding taking vacations in the United States. The American tariffs were particularly punishing to Canada because it buys more American steel than any other country, according to the Canadian government, while nearly 90 percent of Canadian steel and aluminum exports go to the United States. In 2017, the Canadian steel industry employed more than 23,000 Canadians and the aluminum industry about 10,500 workers. After the imposition of the duties, some economists predicted it could cost the Canadian economy more than $3 billion Canadian dollars annually."
54,STEVEN ERLANGER,"War With Iran? Count Us Out, Europe Says","Bruised by the 2003 Iraq war, Europeans are united in opposing a new conflict with Tehran but also leery of contradicting Washington too sharply.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/17/world/europe/war-iran-europe-iraq.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/17/world/17iran-europe1/17iran-europe1-facebookJumbo.jpg,5/17/19 14:28,"In the first gulf war, in 1990-91, the United States led a broad multinational coalition; in the second, in 2003, the European coalition of the willing was essentially reduced to Britain and Poland.

Yet, despite the strains in trans-Atlantic relations in the Trump years, flat-out opposition to Washington remains an uncomfortable place for European nations. Initially, not even pro-American Britain would go along with the Trump administration, with officials defending a senior British general in the coalition fighting the Islamic State who said that there was no enhanced threat from Iran in Iraq and Syria. But that brought an American rebuttal, and soon the Europeans, reluctant to confront Washington directly, softened the criticism. Britain officially rowed back, saying that it now agreed with the Americans, while Germany and the Netherlands suspended their troop training in Iraq, citing the American warnings. (Germany subsequently said it was planning to resume the training exercises.) Window dressing aside, however, there was little doubt about where the Europeans stood on the Iran issue. “Every single European government believes that the increased threat we’re seeing from Iran now is a reaction to the United States leaving the Iran nuclear agreement and trying to force Iranian capitulation on other issues,” said Kori Schake, a former Pentagon official who is now deputy director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies. “They believe that the U.S. is the provocateur and they worry that the U.S. is reacting so stridently to predictable Iranian actions in order to provide a pretext for a U.S. attack on Iran,” Ms. Schake said. It is a far cry from the debate preceding the 2003 Iraq war, which “split Europe in two,” said Tomas Valasek, the director of Carnegie Europe and a former Slovak ambassador to NATO. “This is a case of all European governments saying to Washington that this is insane, we shouldn’t be here, and it’s your fault that we’re actually talking of war.” For a supporter of the trans-Atlantic relationship, he added, “the last thing you want to do is unify Europe on an anti-American basis, and that’s what Trump” and his national security adviser, John R. Bolton, have done. The Europeans are trapped between President Trump and Tehran, trying to keep decent relations with Washington while committed to supporting the 2015 Iran nuclear deal that Mr. Trump mocked and then abandoned. Senior European government officials say they believe that Mr. Trump, as he said on Thursday, does not want a major war in the Middle East. But they also believe that Mr. Bolton does. They often cite a New York Times opinion article by Mr. Bolton in 2015, when he was out of office, entitled “To Stop Iran’s Bomb, Bomb Iran.” And European officials are baffled by Mr. Trump’s insistence that he simply wants to force Iran into new negotiations. Why, they say, would Tehran, whose supreme leader regards Washington as duplicitous in any event, concede or even value any deal done with the president who just abandoned a nuclear deal so painfully negotiated with the last American president? “Why would they trust us now after Trump pulled the plug on the last thing they negotiated with Washington?” Ms. Schake said. The public position of European officials has been to urge “maximum restraint,” as the European foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, put it. That was a riposte to Washington’s stated policy of “maximum pressure” on Tehran, including punishing economic sanctions designed to block its international trade, especially in oil, on which the economy depends. Foreign ministers — including Britain’s Jeremy Hunt and Germany’s Heiko Maas — have spoken about the dangers of escalation and accidental war. “We are very worried about the risk of a conflict happening by accident with an escalation that is unintended,” Mr. Hunt said. Mr. Maas told German legislators that putting intense pressure on Iran added to the risk of an unintended escalation. “What has happened in recent days — acts of sabotage against ships or pipelines — are indications that these dangers are concrete and real,” he said, referring to reports that four oil vessels were recently attacked at the mouth of the Persian Gulf. While initially skeptical of American warnings of an increased threat to its troops from Iran and its allies, most European officials now accept the American concerns, even as they consider the response exaggerated and provocative. Iran’s responses to American pressure were predicted by the Pentagon, Centcom and American intelligence agencies, Ms. Schake said. “So Europeans are exasperated that the U.S. wants them to snap into line for a policy they believe is wrong, and with the consequences that they and the Pentagon and U.S. intelligence all told the Trump administration it would produce.” No one should be surprised, she and others said, that Iran would use its own leverage — including the restarting of uranium enrichment (still within the limits of the nuclear deal), its militias, proxies and arms transfers — within the region to respond to Washington in an asymmetric way. “The Iranians may have walked into a Washington hard-liner trap,” said Jeremy Shapiro, a former senior State Department official who is now research director for the European Council on Foreign Relations. “Iran as usual is sending messages and going up the escalator ladder one-eighth of a step at a time, through proxies,” he said. “They’re following the script. Iranian and U.S. hard-liners have a toxic interaction and feed off each other.” In the first gulf war, in 1990-91, the United States led a broad multinational coalition; in the second, in 2003, the European “coalition of the willing” was essentially reduced to Britain and Poland. Part of Europe’s skepticism is rooted in that 2003 war, when there were charges of fake or exaggerated intelligence, which continue to haunt the reputations of then-loyal European leaders, such as former Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and former President Aleksander Kwasniewski of Poland. “Every European politician who supported George W. Bush was taken out and effectively executed,” Mr. Shapiro said. “Even in the U.K., no way there can be a repeat of that. If the U.S. policy is force, there will be no European support.” But the Trump administration — which has already strained relations with Europe badly through unilateral moves over trade, climate change and relations with Israel and Russia, let alone Iran — probably doesn’t much care what the Europeans think, Mr. Shapiro said: “No one in the administration is expecting much help from Europe over this.” Still, he noted, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made an effort to come to Brussels and speak to European foreign ministers about Iran and American assessments of enhanced threat. For internal administration debates, European views will be taken into account, Mr. Shapiro said. “If there is tacit support or even abstention,” he said, “that can be helpful in the internal debates, to say, ‘The allies are with us or against us.’” European officials consider the debate in Washington over Iran far from over, and they want to do their best, as one official said, to support Mr. Trump in his clear reluctance to get America involved in another messy war in the Middle East."

The delay gives a temporary reprieve to global automakers an… [+861 chars]",the-new-york-times,The New York Times,"WASHINGTON — President Trump agreed on Friday to lift tariffs on metal imports from Mexico and Canada, removing a major irritant for two important allies that in exchange agreed to stop punishing American farmers with their own taxes on pork, cheese and milk. At the same time, Mr. Trump postponed a decision on whether to impose tariffs on automobiles imported from Europe, Japan and other countries for six months, setting a tight deadline for the United States to reach trade deals that have so far proved elusive. Together, the actions remove the threat of an all-encompassing global trade war and allow Mr. Trump to focus on pushing China to agree to the United States’ trade terms, as well as pressuring Europe and Japan to reach a trade deal before the 2020 election. His trade war has hurt many of the farmers who make up his political base, and he is eager to make good on a 2016 campaign promise to rewrite trade deals in America’s favor. “I’m pleased to announce we’ve just reached agreement with Canada and Mexico. We’ll be selling our product into those countries without the imposition of tariffs,” Mr. Trump said on Friday. The United States trade representative said in a statement that the metal tariffs would be removed and both Mexico and Canada “had agreed on the removal of all retaliatory tariffs imposed on American goods by those countries.” The easing of trade tensions in North America could give Mr. Trump more leeway as he pursues an ambitious trade fight with China, which has imposed tariffs on American products in retaliation for the president’s levies on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods. Mr. Trump on Wednesday announced sweeping restrictions against Chinese telecom companies like Huawei, and he has threatened to tax all Chinese imports, prompting concerns from farmers and other businesses caught in the cross-fire. On Friday, it became clear that pressure to reach an accord with Canada and Mexico before the 2020 elections outweighed the president’s affection for the steel and aluminum tariffs he imposed last year. The metal tariffs are linked to a broader free trade agreement, the newly negotiated Nafta, called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Mr. Trump had described the tariffs as a source of leverage in negotiating a revision to that deal, which has yet to be ratified by legislatures in all three countries. But both Republicans and Democrats had said they would not sign off on that deal until the White House removed metal tariffs on Canada and Mexico. They argue that the levies are raising costs for American companies and consumers, and that Canadian and Mexican retaliation is hurting American farmers and businesses. A congressional aide who has been involved in the talks between the three countries said the White House was growing increasingly sensitive to pressure from Republicans in rural states whose farmers have been suffering from reprisal that diminished their access to sell in neighboring markets. Their problems were compounded when talks with China broke down this month, this person said. Vice President Mike Pence, who has spent weeks traversing Midwestern states to sell the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement in Congress, relayed the complaints of manufacturers and farmers hurt by the tariffs to Mr. Trump, telling him, “We’ve got to get moving on this.” While rescinding the metal tariffs will remove one important obstacle to the passage of the trade deal, others remain. House Democrats have insisted that the pact include more labor and environmental protections. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, is in no particular rush to give the president a major domestic policy victory in 2020, according to people familiar with her views. Jesús Seade, the under secretary for North America at Mexico’s Foreign Ministry, said that he hoped that ending the dispute would give “an extra push” toward ratifying the agreement. Mexico will lift its retaliatory tariffs in a couple of days, he said. Speaking from Stelco, a steel producer in Hamilton, Ontario, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada said on Friday that the deal was “pure good news” and would help clear the way for the passage of the agreement. “We are very optimistic we will be able to move forward in coming weeks,” he said. As the White House eased tensions with Canada and Mexico on Friday, it continued to pressure allies elsewhere, including Europe and Japan. Those governments are still not exempt from the steel and aluminum tariffs, and they are likely to bear the brunt of auto tariffs that could reach 25 percent, should Mr. Trump opt to impose them. The White House’s announcement Friday of a delay in determining whether to impose levies on foreign automobiles delivered a temporary reprieve to global automakers and auto suppliers, which had been bracing for punishing tariffs on millions of cars imported into the United States each year. But it also set up a tense six-month period for the White House to reach trade deals with Japan, Europe and other nations that have already been complicated by mistrust and disagreements. In a proclamation Monday, Mr. Trump said that imports of foreign cars and car parts were causing harm to the American automobile industry and threatening national security and that other countries had 180 days to address the problem through trade agreements with the United States. If agreements “to address the national security threat” are not reached, Mr. Trump said he would determine “whether and what further action needs to be taken,” a step that could include imposing 25 percent tariffs on foreign cars. Car companies and industry groups said that a delay did not go far enough and that Mr. Trump should abandon any plan to impose car tariffs. “The continued threat of tariffs on cars and auto parts only creates more uncertainty weakening our economy,” said Neil Bradley, the executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Many outside the administration have criticized the linkage of cars with national security, pointing out that the bulk of American auto imports come from the country’s closest allies. Mexico, Japan, Canada, Germany and South Korea were together responsible for more than 85 percent of American automotive imports in 2018. Canada and Mexico have negotiated exclusions to the car tariffs as part of their earlier trade negotiations, but it is unclear if car tariffs will affect other countries, including South Korea. In a statement, Toyota called the White House’s announcement “a major setback for American consumers, workers and the auto industry,” saying that it “sends a message to Toyota that our investments are not welcomed, and the contributions from each of our employees across America are not valued.” “The idea that U.S. automakers are threatened by automotive imports is fundamentally flawed and ill conceived,” said John Bozzella, the president of Global Automakers, which represents foreign car brands. “No automaker or auto parts supplier asked for this ‘protection.’” The United States has struggled to make headway in preliminary negotiations with the European Union, which has balked at Mr. Trump’s demands to allow more agricultural products like chicken and cheese into Europe. Mr. Trump has repeatedly criticized Europe for flooding the American market with cars while limiting imports of United States vehicles, and has called for revised trade terms that make the relationship more fair. But he also previously rejected a more straightforward proposal from Europe to simply scrap automotive tariffs on both sides of the Atlantic. Speaking to the National Association of Realtors on Friday at a Washington hotel, the president denounced the European Union for putting up trade barriers to American farm products and cars. “The European Union treats us, I would say, worse than China. They’re just smaller,” he said. “They send Mercedes-Benzes in here like they are cookies.” The European Commission said in a statement Monday that it would work constructively with American partners. “Neither the U.S. nor the E.U. can have an interest to enter a trade conflict.” The Trump administration wants Europe to buy more American farm products, like meat and dairy, and says a deal without agriculture will not pass Congress. But Europe insists that agriculture is not on the table. Reaching a deal with Europe in six months could be difficult, especially given that elections for the European Parliament next week are expected to strengthen protectionist parties on both the left and the right. Leaders of the Green coalition in Parliament say they will not sign trade agreements with countries that have not ratified the Paris climate change accord, which Mr. Trump has pulled out of. The United States and Japan have also been discussing a bilateral trade deal that could give American farmers more access to Japan’s market. But those talks, which began nearly two years after Mr. Trump pulled out of a multilateral trade deal with Japan known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, also have yet to move beyond the initial stages. Japanese officials say that they are counting on the close relationship between Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to keep trade negotiations from souring between the two countries. Mr. Trump is scheduled to visit Japan next week, and his hosts are planning a full slate of high-level hospitality. That includes a state dinner with the new emperor and empress, rounds of golf and a visit to a sumo wrestling championship, where Mr. Trump will award the winner’s trophy."

Officials in the Trump administration suggest that Chinas … [+2244 chars]",the-new-york-times,The New York Times,"Last Friday, the White House raised the tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports up to 25 percent. On Monday, China retaliated with tariffs of its own. The trade war is now full-on — except that it’s not really about trade. China does account for the largest share of America’s trade deficit. But many experts don’t seem to think that bilateral trade deficits are a problem in themselves — they’re just a symptom of other issues (if even that). “The overall United States global trade imbalance is the result of economic conditions in the United States — the excess of investment over savings,” Martin Feldstein, a former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, has argued, adding that if America’s trade imbalance with China were eliminated, it would simply shift to other countries. Whether President Trump is misguided in doggedly pursuing tariffs or playing coy and using them as leverage with the Chinese government, America’s continued drive to levy penalties is less about fixing a trade problem than about changing China’s investment rules. In particular, the Trump administration perceives those rules as forcing the transfer of foreign technology to Chinese companies, unfairly helping them. But even American negotiators who parse the trade versus tech issue this clearly tend to overlook an essential fact: The international trade and financial system that was set up after World War II — with the creation of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and, much later, the World Trade Organization (all nurtured and dominated by the United States) — actively encouraged “technological spillovers” from developed economies to developing ones. Under the W.T.O.’s agreements on intellectual property, developed countries are under “the obligation” to provide incentives to their companies to transfer technology to less developed countries. Such transfers were seen to be in the West’s interest, too: Far better that poor countries achieve self-sustaining growth than be dependent on foreign aid, the thinking went. But China did much better than achieve self-sustaining growth. By the late 2000s, it had come to seem too successful, and a threat: The West was struggling then with a major financial crisis (largely of its own doing). Today, the longstanding principle that knowledge transfers are good all-around is being questioned. Do they continue to serve the global interest and should they still be encouraged — even when it comes to China? Or should China be treated as an exception? It is in a class of its own, by dint of both its size and the state’s involvement in its economy. American negotiators have long complained that China’s foreign investment practices are unfair. A report of the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property, published in 2013 and often cited since, estimated that China accounted for 50 to 80 percent of all international intellectual property theft. In its 2018 report, the Office of the United States Trade Representative accused China of using joint ventures to funnel technology to Chinese companies and of failing to protect foreign companies’ intellectual property rights. But the reality is more complex. Yes, American companies have been granted access to some 35 restricted sectors in China — like auto production, oil exploration, nuclear power, telecommunications, banks and medical institutions — only on the condition that they transfer know-how to local partners. Chinese companies are developing electric vehicles with support from Renault-Nissan and Ford. Amazon and Microsoft are being asked to partner — and share technology — with Chinese companies before they can sell cloud-computing services in China. And yes, DuPont and General Motors have sued their Chinese joint-venture partners for misappropriating trade secrets. Outright theft also has sometimes occurred, including in the defense sector, of information about bombers and missile systems. But to say all these things in the same breath is to risk conflating inadequate rules with violations of existing rules that may be adequate, and government policy with the behavior of private actors. Officials in the Trump administration suggest that China’s foreign-investment requirements themselves amount to theft. In many instances, however, technology is being transferred between companies in the context of consensual, negotiated business agreements. Also, violations or near-violations are par for the course during certain stages of a country’s development. That fact doesn’t make them acceptable, but it offers useful context for thinking through how best to react to them. Other rapidly growing economies, including Japan and South Korea in the 1980s, were also accused of unfairly securing technology from foreign partners (or subsidizing their exports). But as those countries’ incomes rose and their own capacity to innovate developed, they started complying with the rules — typically when per capita income reached $25,000. China, at its current growth rates, is more than a decade away from achieving that income level. And yet it has already made more progress than is usually acknowledged toward protecting intellectual property rights. AmCham China’s 2019 China Business Climate Survey Report noted that 59 percent of the more than 300 American companies it interviewed said that China’s enforcement of intellectual property rights had improved over the last five years; 37 percent said it had stayed the same. (China is growing up in other respects, too. Both the I.M.F. and the United States Treasury have recently determined that the Chinese government is not manipulating its currency. And its current account surpluses have virtually evaporated.) That said, penalties for, say, infringing patents remain weak in China and enforcement is lax. The National People’s Congress passed a foreign-investment law in March, but it offered too little on implementation. In fact, the United States’s latest tariffs were prompted by its perception that the Chinese government was backtracking on its commitment to incorporate into Chinese law major terms of the two countries’ draft agreement to end the trade war. The fundamental question, therefore, is this: Are China’s current technology-transfer policies fair, given both past international practice and the country’s extraordinary development? Or, to put the point more provocatively, did China’s growth break the international economic order? The answer partly depends on the existence, or not, of globally accepted guidelines. Just last year, in its World Economic Outlook report, the I.M.F. again highlighted the vital role that the diffusion of technology worldwide has played in driving growth globally. And China now accounts for almost one-third of global growth every year, according to Bloomberg.  A more innovative China also doesn’t mean a less competitive America. For one thing, as the Harvard economist Robert Lawrence has pointed out, developed countries and developing ones generally do not compete in the same product lines. The economist Zhang Jun and others have also argued that much of China’s technological capacities are overstated anyway. Many of the more sophisticated components used in products that China exports to the West (think iPhones) are made elsewhere and merely assembled in China. Curbs on America’s exports of “emerging and foundational technologies” — notably to do with artificial intelligence or fifth-generation (5G) telecommunications networks — will curtail knowledge flows to China. But they will also damage America’s capacity for innovation, American tech experts have argued. (Likewise, Mr. Trump’s decision this week to ban, on security grounds, foreign tech equipment in American telecommunications systems could hurt American companies.) Technology transfers from the most developed states to less developed ones remain beneficial all-around, including for the most developed states — even if the unique features of China’s remarkable growth require adapting existing norms and regulatory mechanisms to better manage those transfers. The Trump administration, which instinctively recoils at multilateral initiatives, is unlikely to want to turn to the W.T.O. or the World Bank. (It should, though, not least because the United States has usually fared well by W.T.O. rulings.) The next best opportunity to at least broach these issues will be during the Group of 20 summit meeting in Osaka, Japan, in June. China’s growth may seem like a challenge to the world’s economic order, but it is other states’ reactions to it that could threaten the system.

T… [+1121 chars]",the-new-york-times,The New York Times,"China usually gets its way. In Washington, on Wall Street and in corporate boardrooms, Beijing has used the country’s size and promise for decades to quell opposition and reward those who helped its rise. Those days may be coming to an end. As it struggles with President Trump’s trade war, a maturing and debt-laden China is discovering that it no longer has the same pull. Members of both political parties in the United States favor a tougher stance against Beijing. Some old business allies are standing on the sidelines or even cheering the Trump administration’s strong stands. China could still prevail on the trade war’s major issues. But the conflict’s length and severity reflect the growing perception that the country no longer holds the promise that once enthralled politicians and businesses in the United States. Many American companies with large, profitable businesses in China do not want to pay expensive tariffs and worry that the United States is antagonizing the Chinese public, said Ker Gibbs, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai. But many of the same businesses also chafe at the numerous restrictions that China has long maintained on foreign companies. “We’re looking at their expanding into global markets, and saying, ‘Wait a minute, why can’t we do that here?’” Mr. Gibbs said. China’s economic slowdown, which could hinder growth globally, is a major reason its influence has ebbed. But there are other factors. The country’s heavy debts, built up over years of lending used to spur growth, limit its options. If it retaliates against the United States sharply by devaluing its currency or shutting factories crucial to global supply chains, the moves could ricochet and hurt its own newfound wealth. Foreign businesses have found it less appealing to make or sell their products in China over the last several years because of heavy restrictions on foreign businesses, stronger local competitors and rising costs. Mr. Trump’s tariffs last year gave many businesses a final reason to look elsewhere.  Call it the ABC supply chain, as in “anywhere but China.”  On Wednesday, Kelly A. Kramer, the chief financial officer of Cisco, the big telecom equipment supplier, told investors that the company had “greatly, greatly reduced” its exposure to China because of the tariffs. Morey, a company near Chicago that makes rugged electronics for bulldozers and other outdoor equipment, reluctantly paid more for printed circuit boards made in China after Mr. Trump imposed 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion a year in Chinese imports last fall. With those tariffs now rising to 25 percent, Morey executives have begun talking to suppliers in Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore. “I was thinking this is a short-term issue that will go away,” said George Whittier, the company’s president and chief operating officer, “and I don’t think you can rationally think that any more.” China holds a lot of cards. It remains a huge profit source for Apple, Boeing, General Motors, Starbucks and other major corporations. It can use its substantial financial firepower and the government’s control over crucial economic levers to endure a protracted trade conflict, while state-run media outlets help stem discontent at home. Chinese officials and experts say the country can stand firm against Western pressure. Even some advocates of more market-oriented policies say Beijing should just make its own decisions now instead of tying them to a trade pact with Washington. “China should focus on its own reform, which will eventually solve some current trade war contentious issues,” said Zhu Ning, a Tsinghua University economist. Still, China has lost some of the swagger and appeal that once opened so many doors in Washington and on Wall Street. China has long used its tremendous size and growth potential as both carrot and stick. Companies that played by its rules could gain access to a market of more than one billion people who were becoming increasingly affluent and eager to spend. Companies that complained could be left out. It worked. G.M. and other companies caved in to demands like being forced to take on local joint venture partners, knowing that they were training future competitors. General Electric sold one complete diesel locomotive from Erie, Pa., to China, then taught the Chinese to build their own. Apple censors its App Store in China. When Google protested censorship and hacking, it was mostly kicked out. Businesses then helped make China’s case in Washington. When China wanted to join the World Trade Organization, the global trade club, it enlisted Wall Street’s help. Businesses helped persuade successive American presidents to refrain from punishing China for manipulating its currency, even as Beijing manipulated its currency. They fought efforts to raise tariffs. China remains vital to many businesses, but the dynamic has shifted. It still grows at a pace that developed countries envy. But its economy has slowed significantly from rates that as recently as 2010 topped 10 percent a year. Since Xi Jinping took power in 2012, the government has taken a stronger hand in business, requiring foreign companies to forge ties with the Communist Party and demanding access to data. Beijing has fewer ways to strike back against the United States now. Its tremendous success in nurturing its own homegrown industries, which has helped China’s economy rise up the value chain, has reduced its imports of American goods, giving it fewer items to hit with tariffs. A decade ago, China bought Jeeps made in Michigan by Chrysler, bulldozers and other construction equipment made in Illinois by Caterpillar and huge diesel engines made in Indiana by Cummins. Now Chrysler makes Jeeps in Changsha and Guangzhou. Caterpillar makes construction equipment in Xuzhou. And Cummins builds engines at factories in Beijing, Chongqing, Hefei, Liuzhou, Xi’an and Xiangyang. “China has been so effective at squeezing manufactured imports out of its market that it has really limited its options to retaliate,” said Brad Setser, a Treasury official in the Obama administration who is now an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations. China’s imports from the United States now fall mostly into four big categories: Boeing aircraft from Washington State; semiconductors, mainly from Intel factories in Oregon; farm products and energy from the Great Plains and Texas; and German-brand sport utility vehicles from South Carolina and Alabama. Although China could still shake the American political system if any harsh retaliation hurt economic growth in the United States, it has fewer opportunities to target electoral swing states and hurt Mr. Trump’s chances of re-election next year. Slapping tariffs on those industries could also have big drawbacks. China needs those chips for its technology upgrades. Targeting Boeing planes would shift more Chinese business to Airbus, giving the European aircraft maker more leverage in negotiations with Beijing. On agriculture, China still does not grow enough soybeans to meet its needs, so higher tariffs on American crops might simply mean higher food prices down the line. China has also shown surprising vulnerabilities, like its dependence on American semiconductor technology and software. Last year, when the United States briefly prohibited American companies from selling technology to the Chinese telecommunications giant ZTE for violating sanctions against Iran and North Korea, ZTE ground to a halt. “The trade friction has also been a cold shower that has made us see our structural shortcomings more clearly,” said a front-page commentary in People’s Daily on Monday that bore a pen name used to signal authoritative positions on international relations.  China has options besides tariffs, but they have disadvantages as well. It could sell a large chunk of the $1.3 trillion in United States Treasury debt that it holds. That could temporarily push up American interest rates. But it would saddle China with large losses. Beijing would have to find someplace else to park the money. Its previous sales, undertaken mainly to shore up the country’s currency in 2015 and early 2016, did not affect the bond market much. Another option would be for China to let its currency slide in value against the dollar, making its goods cheaper abroad and offsetting American tariffs. Doing that could prompt the Trump administration to raise its tariffs even higher. It might also tempt other countries to devalue their currencies, setting off a potentially costly currency war. And a Chinese devaluation could cause Chinese families and households to send their own savings out of the country. China could crack down on American-owned factories in China or on those crucial to the supply chains of American companies. But that could lead still more multinational companies to consider leaving the country.  The dilemma for China is that the longer the trade war lasts, the more companies may decide to invest elsewhere. For now, domestic politics seem more important in China, with the leadership and the general public reacting angrily to what is portrayed in the country as peremptory American demands. “We have the confidence and ability to withstand any external risks and impact,” Geng Shuang, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said on Thursday.

He even made a speech saying China would protect intellectual property, encourage foreign investment, and buy more goods and services from abroad — all changes the United States had been demanding as the countries tried to negotiate a deal. But just a week after that speech, Chinese negotiators sent the Americans a substantially rewritten draft agreement, prompting President Trump to accuse Beijing of reneging on terms that had been settled. That has left hopes for a historic breakthrough in tatters. In China’s top-down political system, where President Xi has amassed formidable power, it’s unlikely that anyone else would have had the authority — or, for that matter, the nerve — to fundamentally alter the emerging pact at this late date. Having apparently made that decision, it is clear that Mr. Xi misjudged Mr. Trump’s eagerness for a deal and how far he could push the American negotiators, according to more than a dozen people, including current and former officials, researchers, lawyers, and trade experts familiar with the deal and how it fell apart. Now Mr. Xi risks being backed into a corner, unable to compromise between his own positions and Mr. Trump’s. A key issue was the United States’ demand that the agreement bind China to setting some of the changes in domestic law. For Mr. Xi, such a move could be seen at home as a sign of caving in. Mr. Xi’s frenetic schedule and highly centralized style of policymaking may also have delayed decisions in the Chinese government about the prospective deal until dangerously late, said a former official, academics and trade group representatives. “No doubt Xi has tightened the overall policy atmosphere so few want to voice opposition,” said James Green, who was the top trade official at the United States Embassy in Beijing until last August and is now a senior adviser at McLarty Associates, a Washington consulting firm. “And that doesn’t leave much room for the negotiators.” Seasoned political insiders have been astonished by the whiplash reversal in the trade talks between the world’s two biggest economies. Now, China’s leaders risk prolonging tensions with the United States by defending their decisions with combative, nationalist rhetoric that could narrow the room for a compromise, experts from both countries said. “You’ll need a strong political decision to accept any compromises now,” Tao Jingzhou, a business and dispute resolution lawyer in Beijing, said in an interview. “The propaganda could turn up nationalist feeling that could further narrow the margin for negotiations.” Chinese officials were not alone in thinking a deal was not far-off. The United States Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said late last month that talks were “getting into the final laps.” Chris Coons, a Democratic senator from Delaware who visited Beijing at that time, said Chinese officials had all said they wanted an agreement on the trade dispute. “One of the things that was impressive was the extent to which every single person we met with delivered the same core message points on a few key themes,” Mr. Coons said in an interview in Beijing soon after his meetings with officials. “And the message on trade was, ‘We are making our best efforts to hear you and to reach an agreement.’ ” But by May 1, Mr. Xi had demanded a substantial recast of the embryonic agreement that his chief negotiator, Liu He, had been haggling over for months with Mr. Trump’s team, people close to the negotiations said. Several sources said the changes were discussed with other Communist Party leaders, which brought into focus worries that the proposed deal could make Mr. Xi and the party look as if they were bowing to pressure. Soon after, the Chinese negotiators sent their American counterparts a version of the draft agreement in a Microsoft Word document, speckled with cuts and changes. The revised document sent from Beijing was a “sea of red” revisions, said Christopher K. Johnson, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, and a former senior China analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency. The exact reasons Mr. Xi and other leaders waited so long before presenting the Trump administration with a new negotiating position are unclear. Mr. Johnson and other American and Chinese experts offered differing views on what drove Mr. Xi to push for the changes. Mr. Xi may have assumed, some said, that Mr. Trump was so eager for an agreement that American negotiators would swallow the last-minute changes. Or, others said, Mr. Xi may have belatedly concluded that changes to Chinese laws demanded by the United States would be an affront to national honor. Some said Mr. Xi might have felt he had to act after the clauses drew criticism from party leaders who had not been briefed earlier. Some experts believe China’s leaders may not have formally considered a full Chinese-language translation of the draft agreement — which had been negotiated using an English-language text — until later on. “The devil is in the detail, especially for lawyers,” said Mr. Tao, the Beijing lawyer. “When you translate an agreement into an official text, there can be a lot of room for different interpretations.” The leadership may also have misread the political landscape in the United States and guessed that Mr. Trump was so eager for an agreement that it was time to press for an advantage. “The most likely explanation is insufficient policy coordination, not an intentional effort to deceive the Americans,” said Scott Kennedy, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington who researches Chinese economic policy. “The impression that Trump wanted a deal for the stock market may have given them some comfort and space, that they thought they could push back,” he said. The Trump administration had demanded stronger penalties for violating foreign patents and tighter laws to prevent the Chinese from demanding that foreign businesses transfer critical technologies. And the administration sought changes to cybersecurity laws that China’s national security establishment saw as interference. These changes would require authorization from China’s national legislature. “These conditions that the Americans raised for an agreement, at least from the political point of view, are extremely difficult to accept,” said Cui Liru, a former president of China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, a prominent state research group. “It is almost asking the change of China’s political system.” The American negotiators read China’s refusal to enshrine its commitments in law as an indication that the Chinese were making promises they did not intend to keep. China’s request that the United States remove all new tariffs as part of a deal was also difficult to accept. The 25 percent tariffs imposed last summer on $50 billion a year of Chinese goods cover some categories deemed critical to national security, such as nuclear reactor parts used by the United States Navy. Democrats and Republicans alike have been leery of scrapping these tariffs, which they hope will prevent critical suppliers from moving to China. The speed with which the two governments descended into verbal mud-wrestling and new tariffs and counter-tariffs surprised even seasoned analysts. After the negotiations broke off on Friday and Mr. Trump announced a fresh round of tariffs on China, Mr. Liu, China’s chief negotiator, appeared to hesitate between tough talk and mild words. Speaking to Chinese journalists in Washington, Mr. Liu laid out “matters of principle” for Beijing that he said must be respected in the talks. On the other hand, Mr. Liu said the differences were small and nothing unusual. “I think these are small complications that are normal in bilateral negotiations,” Mr. Liu said. “I’m cautiously optimistic about the future.” As the deal unraveled, Communist Party-run media outlets flipped from muted restraint about tensions to daily salvos rebuking the United States and dismissing any criticisms of China. The official Chinese news media has described the United States this week as an “all-out bully,” a “paper tiger” and a schemer who, as in an ancient Chinese tale, entraps a guest by inviting him to a banquet. Xinhua, the official news agency, suggested that the United States was acting like a deluded colonialist holdover. “If anyone today regards China as the China of old, prey to dismemberment, as a ‘soft persimmon’ that can be squeezed at will, their minds are stuck in the 19th century and they’re deceiving themselves,” Xinhua said in an editorial on the breakdown in trade negotiations. “The Chinese government is preparing the public for a protracted and costly trade war, while remaining open to a face-saving deal,” said Jessica Chen Weiss, an associate professor of government at Cornell University who studies Chinese foreign policy and public opinion. The combative words threaten to complicate and prolong the trade dispute, even if Mr. Trump or Mr. Xi desires a truce. Mr. Xi’s strategy of engaging in a war of words against other countries has often overreached. In a dispute with South Korea over Seoul’s decision to let the United States deploy an antimissile system, China struck a hard line against the country — only to find itself a year later in a losing position with limited options. “It could need a good six to 12 months before we get back to a serious deal in the works,” said Mr. Johnson, the analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Still, the Chinese government seems to be leaving some room for flexibility. The editorials generally avoid personal attacks on Mr. Trump. And Mr. Xi has not publicly commented on the trade tensions, leaving room to subtly shift his demands. Mr. Trump said Monday that he would meet Mr. Xi during a Group of 20 leaders meeting in Osaka, Japan, next month. But such a meeting would probably at best pave the way for more talks. “It is very hard to think China will cave in or surrender to these pressures,” said Wang Yong, the director of the Center for International Political Economy at Peking University. “Public opinion definitely matters.”"

The product of a merger of the American Civil War Center and the Museum of the Confederacy, the new museum seeks to tell an inclusive story of the war in hopes of dispelling some of the myths and misconceptions that still dominate popular understanding. “This is a period of history that’s been so distorted for a variety of reasons,” the museum’s chief executive, Christy Coleman, told me, “where memory has taken over the actual history, and that collective memory is not historical in many cases.” Modern scholarship on the American Civil War takes a broad view of the conflict, more interested in social, economic and political circumstances than battlefield tactics; more concerned with the perspectives of ordinary people — soldiers, civilians, Native Americans and enslaved people — than individual military leaders. [Join Jamelle Bouie as he shines a light on overlooked writing, culture and ideas from around the internet. For exclusive thoughts, photos and reading recommendations, sign up for his newsletter.] Public memory of the war is a little different. It is still heavily influenced by work like “The Civil War” by the documentary filmmaker Ken Burns, which, the historian Keri Leigh Merritt writes, concentrates on “hard-fought battles, valiant, virile soldiers, and heart-wrenching tales of romantic love and loss.” More worrisome, as President Trump’s praise of Robert E. Lee as “one of the great generals” demonstrates, are those Americans whose ideas about the conflict owe more to after-the-fact Confederate propaganda than any actual history. That truth makes the new museum’s location especially significant. The first significant monument to a Confederate military figure, a standing statue of Stonewall Jackson, was unveiled on Oct. 26, 1875, in Richmond, the former capital of the Confederacy, just 10 years after Robert E. Lee’s surrender at Appomattox Court House. Thousands of Confederate veterans joined tens of thousands of onlookers in a parade down the streets of a city decorated with flags, flowers and portraits of Jackson. They passed arches and towers bearing inscriptions like “Warrior, Christian, Patriot,” ending in Capitol Square, where the statue was unveiled. Gov. James Kemper, himself a Confederate veteran, welcomed them. The former Confederate capital was now a center of Confederate memorialization and “Lost Cause” ideology. Over the next decades, it would help develop both. In 1890, the city unveiled an imposing equestrian statue of Lee, in a ceremony attended by at least 100,000 people. And in 1896 the all-female Confederate Memorial Literary Society opened the Confederate Museum, an institutional home for Lost Cause revisionism. This began to change in the 1960s, as the civil rights movement swept the South and historians grappled with the centennial of the Civil War itself. Self-examination under new leadership led to a revamping of the museum and its mission. In 1970, the Confederate Museum changed its name to the Museum of the Confederacy to emphasize an interest in scholarship rather than veneration. In the 1970s and ’80s, as historical sites in the state began to look deeper at slavery and the lives of enslaved people, the museum worked with the National Endowment for the Humanities to develop historically grounded exhibitions on the Confederacy. In 1991, it debuted “Before Freedom Came,” a major show devoted to slavery in the South. Coleman, who was then the director of African-American Programs at Colonial Williamsburg, contributed to that exhibition, which used objects and artifacts to illuminate the experience of slavery in the South. In 2008, after nearly 10 years as president and C.E.O. of the Charles H. Wright Museum of African-American History in Detroit, she joined the American Civil War Center as president, which brought her back to Richmond. The merger came five years later. After six more years of work — including the transfer of 100,000 Civil War artifacts and photographs from the Museum of the Confederacy — the American Civil War Museum was ready. The first things you see when you walk into the museum are huge, colorized photos of key figures — Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman and Jefferson Davis. Similar historic photos, all colorized, decorate the walls and displays. This might seem like a minor touch, but there’s something about seeing actual skin tones and eye colors — the small details of uniforms or civilian dress — that helps you see these historical actors as actual individuals who experienced the world not unlike yourself.  The same is true of the objects and artifacts, from firearms and military equipment to dolls and handmade utensils, which help ground the period in a material world. Knowledge of Confederate prison camps, for example, is greatly enhanced when you can take a close look at something like the objects imprisoned soldiers made to trade for food and clothing. Similarly, galleries devoted to individual battles and campaigns emphasize the chaos and confusion of the war, and the extent to which, in the moment, no one knew how it would unfold. The museum pays great attention to detail and even minutiae, but it isn’t myopic. From beginning to end, the war is framed as a defining conflict for American democracy, a struggle for freedom whose outcome had world-historical implications. And to emphasize this point, the galleries do not end with surrender and reconciliation; they end with Reconstruction and its aftermath. Visitors are confronted with two images and artifacts: a painting of the first elected black members of Congress; a painting of Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson, signifying Lost Cause nostalgia; and a set of well-preserved robes that belonged to a member of the Ku Klux Klan. Toward the end of our conversation, Coleman returned to the contrast between memory, which can flatter our recollections of ourselves, and history, which is “always challenging.” For many Americans, the kinds of stories told in this museum will challenge their preconceptions. There are just too many myths about the Civil War — too much unreflective memory — for that not to be the case. With that fact in mind, Coleman hopes the museum can dispel those myths, bring clarity to the memories and allow the people who experienced the war to speak for themselves. “If we had let them do that from the beginning,” she said, “we might not be dealing with some of the messes we’re dealing with now.” The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Officials often attribute the shortfall to one-off quirks in the data, though, and the Fed c… [+995 chars]",the-new-york-times,The New York Times,"WASHINGTON — Federal Reserve officials are increasingly worried that inflation is too low and could leave the central bank with less room to maneuver in an economic downturn. In recent speeches and remarks, several Fed officials have expressed a strong concern that persistently low inflation may be a more permanent economic phenomenon, one that could hamstring the Fed’s room to cut interest rates next time the American economy enters a recession. The Fed strives to achieve full employment and stable price increases around 2 percent annually. The labor market has been humming, with unemployment at its lowest level since 1969 and wages climbing gradually. Price gains, on the other hand, have come in consistently short of the Fed’s goal, and eased to 1.6 percent in March. The inflation conundrum is fueling what seems to be an intellectual rift on the interest rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee. The Fed’s chairman, Jerome H. Powell, has dismissed the weakness in price increases, attributing it during a news conference this month to “transient” factors that would probably not last. On Thursday, Lael Brainard, a Fed governor, suggested that inflation has slipped lower in a more lasting way. “The fact that inflation has been running somewhat below our longer-run goal of 2 percent may not be entirely due to labor market slack or to transitory shocks,” Ms. Brainard said in a speech at the National Tax Association’s spring symposium in Washington. Because the federal funds rate factors in price gains, permanently lower inflation would leave policymakers less room to cut interest rates and stimulate economic growth in a downturn. And when the public stops believing that the central bank can or will push price gains higher, it is more likely to accept stable wages and prices, miring inflation at its low level. The problem is “a question of our broader credibility,” Neel Kashkari, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said in an interview. Estimates by the Minneapolis Fed suggest that inflation expectations have already fallen too low, to 1.7 percent. “That’s equivalent to a little more than one rate cut that we’ve taken off the table.” Ms. Brainard said the Fed could prove to the public that it was committed to hitting its price goal by allowing inflation to run above 2 percent for a “couple of years.” She suggested that the Fed could even tolerate a run-up in import inflation that pushed prices above the Fed’s goal — a possibility as President Trump wages a trade war with China. “The Federal Reserve could use that opportunity to communicate that a mild overshooting of inflation is consistent with our goals and to align policy with that statement,” she said. Mr. Trump’s tariffs, which increased to 25 percent on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods last week and may be imposed on an additional $300 billion of imports, could lift consumer prices in the United States. On Thursday, Walmart, one of the nation’s largest retailers, said Mr. Trump’s tariffs would raise consumer prices. On Wednesday, John Williams, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and vice chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee, also raised concerns about inflation, saying in a speech in Zurich that global monetary policymakers could find themselves in a bind if they cannot coax prices up. Price gains have been consistently weak in Japan and the European Union, among other advanced economies. “Investors view these low inflation readings not as an aberration, but rather a new normal,” Mr. Williams said. He argued that central banks should revamp their policy approaches to deal with a low-rate, low-price-gain reality. “Absent such changes, central banks will be severely challenged to achieve stable economies and well-anchored inflation expectations.” Businesses, consumers and investors in the United States have all been lowering their inflation outlooks. Market-based indicators of expectations have fallen off sharply, and two recent Fed surveys show that both households and professional forecasters see weaker inflation over the next several years. Given the shaky backdrop, the Fed is engaging in a yearlong review of its own policy strategies. Mr. Powell has described that process as one likely to result in evolution rather than revolution, while other officials have expressed more optimism that it could drive substantial change in how the Fed approaches monetary policy. Areas up for review include the way the Fed targets inflation. Right now, the Fed shoots for a 2 percent symmetric inflation target, meaning it is always trying to hit exactly that rate. It could instead shoot for 2 percent on average, for example, meaning it would offset low inflation today with higher inflation later. But some Fed officials are encouraging a different type of shift. Mr. Kashkari said on Thursday that merely tweaking the Fed’s framework would not be enough. The Fed itself has been the problem, he said, by raising interest rates too aggressively in this economic expansion even when the labor market has room to grow. In effect, the Fed may have unnecessarily muted inflation. While the jobless rate is historically low, workers have been coming back into the labor market, keeping monthly payroll gains near 200,000. That is a surprisingly robust level a decade into the expansion. The Fed has lifted rates nine times since 2015 to pre-empt higher prices amid labor market tightening. Fed officials have pledged to be patient before making further increases, and all of them want to stand pat until economic data push them in one direction or another. Mr. Kashkari said he did not think that a rate cut or two, or a tweaked framework, would be enough to restore the Fed’s credibility. “The bigger, more important, question is: If we were not willing to allow inflation to climb above 2 percent before raising rates this time, why would any price level target be credible in the future?” he said. “We need to own up to the fact that we’re responsible. It’s not a mystery.”"

Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning, We’re covering a disagreement on Iran intelligence, President Trump’s immigration plan, and the cause of a deadly California wildfire. The White House escalated its warnings about Iran based on photographs of fully assembled missiles in the Persian Gulf, American officials said. The images of the missiles, which had been placed on small boats by Iranian paramilitary forces, were said to have prompted fears of potential attacks on U.S. naval vessels, commercial ships and American troops in Iraq.  But others — including Europeans, Iraqis and members of both parties in Congress — said the moves could be defensive acts against what Tehran sees as provocations by Washington. The reliability of the underlying intelligence has provoked fierce debate among factions in the White House, the Pentagon and the C.I.A., and from U.S. allies, reflecting a deep mistrust of President Trump’s national security team.  Reaction: To Iraqis, the warnings and threats about Iran echo the months before the U.S. invasion in 2003. Iraqi officials say they have warned militias tied to Iran against provoking U.S. forces. Alabama’s governor signed into law on Wednesday a measure to ban most abortions in the state. Architects of the legislation have said that its purpose is to persuade the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that recognized a woman’s constitutional right to end a pregnancy. But the short-term challenge to abortion rights is likely to come from less extreme measures, our Supreme Court correspondent writes. The court led by Chief Justice John Roberts may prefer to chip away at rights rather than to overturn Roe outright. As soon as Monday, the court could announce whether it will hear challenges to abortion restrictions in Indiana and Louisiana.  See for yourself: Alabama is the seventh state this year to narrow the window for abortion. Here’s how limits have changed across the country.  Go deeper: The spate of new abortion rules began last fall, after Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined the Supreme Court. President Trump issued an executive order on Wednesday to stop American telecommunications companies from installing foreign-made equipment that poses a national security risk.  The order effectively banned sales by Huawei, China’s leading networking company. White House officials called the order “agnostic,” declining to single out China. But it is the most extreme move in the Trump administration’s fight against China’s tech sector, and it comes amid an escalating trade war, with tariffs imposed on hundreds of billions of dollars in goods in the past week.  Another angle: Few issues have defined Mr. Trump’s presidency more than his love for tariffs, which historians say is rooted in his experiences as a businessman in the 1980s, when Japan was rising as an economic power. “The Daily”: Today’s episode looks at the effects of the trade war in the Midwest. President Trump is set to unveil today an overhauled immigration plan that would significantly increase education and skill requirements for those allowed to move to the U.S. The proposal would also vastly scale back the system of family-based immigration, though it would not reduce the overall level of migration to the country. Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and a White House adviser, spent months working on the plan, which officials conceded was a long way from becoming a legislative reality. Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama failed to achieve a consensus on immigration policy, and Mr. Trump’s proposal has little chance of passing muster with increasingly divided lawmakers. The details: The new plan would provide opportunities for immigrants with no job offers or specific skills to work in the U.S. if they can demonstrate English proficiency and educational attainment, and pass a civics exam. Cannabidiol is a molecule derived from the cannabis plant, and CBD-infused products that promise vague but powerful benefits seem to be everywhere.

California wildfires: Power lines belonging to Pacific Gas & Electric, the state’s largest electrical utility, caused the Camp Fire in 2018, state officials concluded on Wednesday. Proposed fur ban: A bill to ban fur sales has polarized New Yorkers, pitting animal rights activists against black pastors and Hasidic leaders. Opioid crisis: The Metropolitan Museum of Art said it would stop accepting gifts from members of the Sackler family linked to the makers of OxyContin.  Snapshot: Above, the Mississippi River, which gushed into Davenport, Iowa, at record levels two weeks ago, had retreated toward its banks by Monday.

Late-night comedy: Stephen Colbert criticized Alabama’s new abortion law. “They’re going to throw them right in the Alabama slammer for 99 years,” he said. “Let’s see, it’s 2019, so by the time those doctors get out of jail in Alabama, it will be 1895.” What we’re reading: This two-part series by Erik Wemple in The Washington Post, which scours the Mueller report for mentions of the news media and tells us that the reporting was validated.

Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning, We start today with new intelligence on Iran, another abortion ban in the U.S. and a defining moment for UEFA. The White House’s escalated warnings about a threat from Iran, which some government officials and foreign allies are skeptical about, were prompted by photos of missiles on small boats in the Persian Gulf, some of which were loaded by Iranian paramilitary forces.  The photos raised fears that Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps would fire the missiles at U.S. naval ships. It is a different kind of threat than the U.S. has previously seen from Iran, according to three American officials.  Reaction: The State Department ordered a partial evacuation of the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, which some considered an overreaction.  Big picture: Some believe the recent developments, combined with additional intelligence about threats against commercial shipping and attacks by Iranian proxy forces, could indicate that Iran is preparing to attack the U.S. or its allies. But other officials said the moves could  be defensive.  Gov. Kay Ivey of Alabama signed the nation’s most restrictive abortion law, which bans almost all abortions, with no exception in cases of rape or incest. The law will go into effect in six months at the earliest. Lower courts will almost certainly block it, so attention is turning to the Supreme Court. Activists hope the law will force a challenge to the nationwide right to an abortion.  The measure threatens doctors with nearly a century in prison for terminating a pregnancy unless the woman’s life is in serious danger. Supreme Court: There is no guarantee that justices would hear a case involving the Alabama law, even though it was designed as a direct challenge to the court’s landmark Roe v. Wade ruling in 1973, which guarantees a woman’s right to end her pregnancy. Big picture: Alabama is the seventh U.S. state to pass abortion restrictions this year. The White House is delaying for six months a decision on whether to impose levies on foreign cars and car parts, people familiar with the situation said. The move would have taken aim at Japan and Europe. The Treasury secretary also announced that the U.S., Mexico and Canada were nearing a deal on metal tariffs. The developments reflect the administration’s reassessment of aspects of its tariff strategy as it focuses on the all-encompassing trade war with China. Trade friction with China continues to rise. President Trump moved to essentially block sales by Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant, to U.S. firms, in an executive order on Wednesday.  Go deeper: With the U.S. and China openly contemplating how to inflict pain on each other, the rest of the world is fretting about becoming collateral damage, our economics correspondent writes. One casualty in China: The Alibaba Group, the country’s largest e-commerce company, reported its second-slowest pace of revenue expansion since early 2016.  The week of June 3 could be an important one for Brexit. It’s when a fourth — and almost certainly final — vote on a plan to leave the European Union is scheduled to take place. Prime Minister Theresa May has promised to step down if Parliament approves her unpopular plan, but she may face an exit anyway if Parliament rejects it a fourth time. She is promising to bring Parliament an improved piece of legislation that she hopes will be more attractive to opposition lawmakers.

This Sunday, HBO will show the final episode of “Game of Thrones” to audiences in more than 170 countries. While some viewers live in fear of running across a spoiler, others embrace the idea of getting a jump on the plot twists. They may be on to something. In a 2011 study, psychologists at the University of California, San Diego, found that spoilers could enhance enjoyment. They gave people various short stories with one of three presentations: a spoiler paragraph before the story, a spoiler edited into the beginning of the story, or unspoiled. Subjects preferred the advance spoilers. A later study found that they help people better understand the plot. However, another study found that the medium mattered: People enjoyed spoiled episodes of “The Twilight Zone” less. Then there’s anecdotal evidence. The Times’s Jenna Wortham got over having the “Game of Thrones” episode known as “The Red Wedding” ruined, and now relies on spoilers as “virtual Xanax.” She doesn’t, however, dish them out.

Mr. Trump issued an executive order instructing the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, to ban transactions “posing an unacceptable risk” but did not single out any nation or company. The action has long been expected and is the latest salvo in the administration’s economic and security battle with China. It is also the most extreme move in the Trump administration’s fight against China’s tech sector. The executive order was “agnostic,” White House officials said in a call with reporters, declining to single out China as the focus. “This administration will do what it takes to keep America safe and prosperous and to protect America from foreign adversaries” targeting vulnerabilities in American communications infrastructure, the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said in a statement. But in a clear strike against Huawei, the Commerce Department separately announced on Wednesday that it had placed the company and its dozens of affiliates on a list of firms deemed a risk to national security. The listing will prevent it from buying American parts and technologies without seeking United States government approval. “This will prevent American technology from being used by foreign owned entities in ways that potentially undermine U.S. national security or foreign policy interests,” Mr. Ross said in a statement. [Read more about how the order takes a shot directly at Huawei’s business.] The Commerce Department will also write the rules for reviewing transactions that fall under the executive order’s ban over the next 150 days, the officials said. The department said it would work across the administration on the new rules, consulting with the attorney general, Treasury secretary and other agency heads. The order, which applies only to future transactions, left many questions unanswered, including how the department will define foreign adversaries and establish criteria to ban companies from selling equipment to the United States. The executive action did not address concerns by rural carriers that the order would hit them particularly hard. Some of them rely on equipment that already contains parts by Huawei and other Chinese companies. Mr. Trump declared the threat posed by foreign adversaries on American telecommunications networks a national emergency under a law used to impose sanctions against nations like Iran and Russia. Led by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, American officials have warned allies for months that the United States would stop sharing intelligence if they use Huawei and other Chinese technology to build the core of their fifth-generation, or 5G, networks. The networks promise not only faster cellular service, but also the connection of billions of “internet of things” devices — such as autonomous cars, security cameras and industrial equipment — to a new internet architecture. Pentagon and American intelligence officials have warned that Chinese firms will be able to control the networks and have expressed concerns not only that secure messages could be intercepted or secretly diverted to China, but that the Chinese authorities could order Huawei to shut down the networks during any conflict, disrupting American infrastructure as diverse as gas pipelines and cellphone networks. Huawei has denied those charges, and its chief executive has said he would shut down the company rather than obey Chinese government orders to intercept or divert internet traffic. American officials say he would have no choice: Chinese law requires that the country’s firms obey instructions from the nation’s Ministry of State Security. Mr. Trump has been deeply involved, quietly meeting with American telecommunications executives at the White House and weighing different versions of the executive order. He has insisted that the United States must “win” at the 5G competition, only to be told that no American firms make the core switches that will direct 5G internet traffic. The executive order came amid an escalating trade war between the United States and China, with the two sides imposing hundreds of billions of dollars of tariffs in recent days. Mr. Trump has accused the Chinese government of unfair trade practices and announced increased tariffs on an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese goods last week. But few issues have gained as much bipartisan support in Washington as the Trump administration’s warnings of the security threats posed by Huawei and ZTE, another company with deep links to the Chinese government. The calls have gotten so intense that some have warned of a new red scare, and Chinese officials have said the United States has moved beyond caution to paranoia. On Wednesday, Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, called the order “a needed step” that “reflects the reality that Huawei and ZTE represent a threat to the security of U.S. and allied communications networks.” He pushed for further action. “We have yet to see a compelling strategy from this administration on 5G,” he said in a statement. “A coherent coordinated and global approach is critically needed.” The major mobile phone companies have renounced the use of Huawei equipment in their 5G systems, but the order will ensure that smaller, rural telecom companies avoid Huawei when they build new networks. Because 5G systems feature high-speed, low-range equipment, the technology is more suited for now for urban areas than rural areas. But Huawei remains appealing to rural networks because it is cheaper than alternatives. The ban could also help with the Trump administration’s campaign to get European allies to block Huawei. Some allies had questioned why they should block Huawei if the United States had not. Other European officials have suspected that Mr. Trump will soften or eliminate the ban as part of a trade deal with China. Most major allies have resisted the Trump administration’s push, except Australia, which banned Huawei last summer. The White House, intelligence officials and lawmakers from both parties argue that China has already shaped its telecommunications and that tech industries have also given rise inside Chinese territory to facial recognition, constant surveillance of the population and human rights abuses. American officials have also warned that China’s exports of Huawei and other tech products have allowed other authoritarian nations to spy on their citizens and access sensitive security and trade secrets. “We must have a cleareyed view of the threats that we face and be prepared to do what is necessary to counter those threats,” Ajit Pai, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, said in a statement. “Today’s executive order does just that.” But even if Huawei is banned from the United States, it will likely control 40 to 60 percent of the networks around the world. It has made a strong marketing pitch in Africa, Latin America and parts of Asia where it holds huge economic influence. American officials have said China has offered subsidized prices and low-interest loans to outmaneuver the few Western competitors, chiefly Nokia and Ericsson, both European firms. The United States will have to connect to those nations — and must prepare for a day when the American government and companies will have to live in “dirty networks,” Sue Gordon, the deputy director of national intelligence, recently warned. In January, prosecutors in Washington State charged two units of Huawei of conspiring to steal trade secrets from T-Mobile and of wire fraud. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he doubted that Chinese companies could meet American standards and laws on surveillance. “There is no way in hell China can meet those criteria because of the way they’re governed,” Mr. Graham said at a hearing this week. “The only way China can meet the criteria is to stop being China.” The Federal Communications Commission is considering regulations that would bar broadband providers that receive federal subsidies from using Huawei or ZTE equipment in their networks. It also recently approved an order that barred China Mobile Limited from providing service in the United States. The agency said it was exploring similar rules against China Unicom and China Telecom Corporation."

President Trump’s outrages, absurdities and indelicacies arrive with such frequency that they numbingly blur together, and to focus and comment on each is to give him too much of what he thrives on — attention — and be debilitated by his dominance of your thoughts and passions. That’s why many of you rightly cry foul about the media’s obsession with him, and it’s why I’m judicious, or try to be, about how much real estate he gets in my columns. But there are utterances and actions of his that can’t go unexamined, breaches of decorum, diplomacy or normalcy that stand out from the rest or precisely distill his character. And the recent revelation that he would like to put himself at the center of the nation’s most prominent Independence Day celebration — moving the fireworks to a new spot in Washington and making a speech as part of the occasion — falls into that category. Most of his predecessors did nothing of the kind. They understood that the day belonged to the country, not its leader, and they didn’t conflate the two. Trump does, all the time, and it’s alternately annoying, confounding and galling. If you’re not thrilling to his vision and submitting to him, you’re possibly guilty of treason — remember that rant? If you’re asking legitimate questions about unholy alliances that he may have forged or conflicts of interest he may possess, you’re orchestrating a coup. Trumpian logic, more narcissistic than syllogistic, holds that if it’s the president’s job to lift up the country, then it’s the country’s job to lift up the president — spiritually, financially, with appointments for his cronies and sycophants, with jobs for his kin, with applause and of course with parades. A parade: That’s how this whole impulse to convert the Fourth of July into the Fourth of Trump started, according to reporting by The Washington Post. In Paris, beside President Emmanuel Macron, Trump beheld a Bastille Day procession with all its military hardware, and he wanted the same in Washington, the same for him, tanks in the streets, fighter jets in the air. But that was too financially costly and politically risky, so now this: a tentative plan for a starring role amid the starbursts that less needy and more dignified presidents were content to marvel at, not exploit. For Trump, everything — a national holiday, America itself — is an opportunity for brand enhancement, another tall building on which to slap the letters of his name in gold. And his response to effacement is hyperbole and swagger: He’s like one of those animals that puffs itself up when predators come around, using illusory might to conceal intrinsic weakness. Is it any accident that in the middle of an escalating feud with congressional Democrats, as the more damning aspects of Robert Mueller’s report sank in and his namesake was served a subpoena by a Republican-led Senate committee, he played host to and praised a loathsome autocrat, Viktor Orban of Hungary; again flaunted his friendship with Vladimir Putin; toughened his talk about Iran; and ratcheted up his trade war with China? For Trump, vulnerability begets a pantomime of super-potency. He envies Orban, Putin and their ilk. They don’t have to deal with so much disrespect and dissent. They just crush it. His designs on Independence Day call to mind those sorts of leaders: their vanities, shamelessness and equation of national interest with self-interest. Presidents before Trump were plenty vain — it’s close to a job requirement — and presidents before Trump presented themselves as vessels of the American story and symbols of American values. Barack Obama certainly did, speaking of Kenya and Kansas and the way this country brought such strands together in a singular context of diversity and opportunity. He was right. And Trump is right to regard himself as an essentially American character who parlayed confidence, showmanship and a daredevil’s approach to ethics into boundless fame and considerable riches. But he’s neither synonymous with the country nor indispensable to it, obvious distinctions that routinely elude him. “I alone can fix it,” he said during his speech at the Republican National Convention in 2016, and that was no aberration. More like a motto, perhaps stitched onto a throw pillow that he uses for lumbar support while slumping at the Resolute Desk. Independence Day commemorates the breaking free from insufficiently humble rule. It pays tribute to a country being born, not a leader being crowned. And Trump would surely fashion remarks like those during his belated visit to American troops abroad, when he performed an aria of self-congratulation — the only song he knows. It’s music so familiar at this point that it barely registers. But sometimes you need to pause and listen. And sometimes you need to say how ugly it is.

The Alibaba Group, China’s largest e-commerce company, said on Wednesday that revenue increased by 51 percent in the March quarter from the same period last year. That topped Wall Street’s expectations, and was a pickup from the quarter before. But it was still the company’s second-slowest pace of revenue expansion since early 2016. For the full year that ended March 31, revenue also grew by more than half. The company said, however, that the increase was partly the result of adding several recently acquired businesses, such as the takeout delivery service Ele.me, to its sales computations. Without those, it said, full-year sales would have increased by just under two-fifths, the slowest growth in three years. Alibaba also said the number of customers on its Chinese retail marketplaces for the full year that ended in March had grown to more than 650 million, an increase of over 100 million. China’s economy has slowed since the tariff fight with the United States began last year. Diplomacy with Washington has frayed. Alibaba’s enormous size makes the company a closely watched bellwether for consumer and business sentiment in China, even if it’s an obstacle to finding new ways to make money. Alibaba’s scale and breadth may also put it in a better position than many other Chinese businesses to weather the present choppiness. With services from commerce and food delivery to payments and travel booking now under its umbrella, Alibaba has built such a vast ecosystem of interconnected products and platforms that its hold on Chinese consumers and merchants is almost unassailable, said David Dai, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in Hong Kong. Alibaba is “over all in a much stronger position as compared to any other internet or e-commerce company in China,” Mr. Dai said. During a conference call on Wednesday, the company’s executive vice chairman, Joseph C. Tsai, urged analysts to look beyond what he called “the elephant in the room”: China’s economic confrontation with the United States. More important for Alibaba, Mr. Tsai said, is the long-term increase in consumer spending by China’s middle class. The company would also benefit, he said, if China agreed to import more American goods as part of a trade settlement, because Alibaba is already a partner to global brands that cater to China’s growing ranks of shopaholics. “Those are the more significant drivers of our business, as opposed to quarter-to-quarter G.D.P. or industrial production,” Mr. Tsai said. Yet in a season of high anxiety about the trade war and the global economy, China’s entire tech sector is feeling the pressure. Leading companies have laid off workers. Start-ups, including some that Alibaba has invested in, are struggling. Coders are protesting long hours and unpaid overtime — a sign, industry observers say, that the years of breakneck growth and boundless optimism for Chinese tech companies are past. Alibaba has said it will not lay off any employees this year. But the company has not been immune to strain. On Wednesday, Alibaba’s chief executive, Daniel Zhang, said the company would continue to hold off on charging merchants more to advertise on its shopping sites, despite the harm it would cause to revenue growth. Such ads, along with other services that help merchants reach customers, represent the biggest part of Alibaba’s sales, and nearly all of its profit. Unlike Amazon, Alibaba does not pocket proceeds from merchandise sales on its platforms. It makes money by charging third-party sellers to use its digital shelves and signboards. Alibaba has said it will avoid ramping up ad sales until it has collected more data about whether new personalized ads in its shopping app are successfully persuading customers to hand over more of their money. But Alibaba executives have also said the company does not want to add to its merchants’ expenses at a time when many of them are already jittery about the economy. Instead of trying to make more money by charging more for ads, Mr. Zhang said Wednesday, the company plans to invest in enticing more people, particularly those who live in China’s smaller cities and towns, into conducting their lives within Alibaba’s consumer universe. More than two-thirds of the new users on Alibaba’s Chinese shopping platforms this past year lived outside the country’s megacities, the company said."

Tariffs may be here to stay, as what first seemed to be a temporary bargaining tool is starting to look like the way of the future, Ana Swanson of the NYT writes. • The U.S. now has the highest tariff rate among developed countries, outranking Canada, Germany and France, as well as China, Russia and Turkey, according to a Deutsche Bank economist. • Mr. Trump has said that he is looking “very strongly” at imposing additional levies on nearly every Chinese import, following up on new 25 percent tariffs on $250 billion worth of goods. • He also faces a Friday deadline to determine whether he will proceed with a threat to impose global auto levies. Mr. Trump is in no rush to back down. “When the time is right, we will make a deal with China,” Mr. Trump tweeted yesterday. He later told reporters, “Our economy is fantastic; theirs is not so good. We’ve gone up trillions and trillions of dollars since the election; they’ve gone way down since my election.” (His close allies reportedly say backing down is not an option, as he sees the clash as helping his 2020 election prospects.) But reaching a deal may be hard even if Mr. Trump wanted to. The U.S. and China “seem to be digging into their positions in ways that will be hard to resolve with the mutual face-saving that typically turns high-stakes negotiations into deals,” Neil Irwin of the NYT writes. “It is not clear what the offramps might be that would allow a de-escalation.” “For now, the American economy remains strong, with rising wages and the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years,” Ms. Swanson writes. “But with less trade, American jobs up and down the value chain that are seemingly unrelated to importing and exporting goods could suffer, including research and development, retail and marketing products.” U.S. stocks recovered from their trade shock yesterday, with their largest gain in a month. “Investors are trying to adjust to the ratcheting up of trade tension,” Matt Phillips of the NYT writes. More: Mr. Trump argued that interest rate cuts by the Fed would make it “game over” for China in the trade war. And some in China say that the two nations benefit from their relationship more than they admit.  San Francisco yesterday banned the use of facial recognition software by the police and other agencies. It is the first major American city to block the tool, which many police forces and government agencies are increasingly employing to identify criminals. The decision was made by an 8-to-1 vote by the city’s Board of Supervisors. (There’s an obligatory second vote next week, but it’s seen as a formality.) There are big tensions here, beyond the fact that the ban comes from a city that has been pivotal in building the A.I. software that underpins the technology. • Supporters of the ban say that facial recognition gives the government the power to track people going about their daily lives, and is an invasion of privacy that is incompatible with a healthy democracy. And because the software’s use is largely unregulated, it is difficult to know how widespread it is. • Critics argue that there is a clear public safety value to the technology for keeping public spaces secure. (The new rules, however, don’t affect its use at federally controlled facilities at San Francisco International Airport and the Port of San Francisco, and there are exemptions for some important investigations.) The move may spur other cities to follow suit. Similar bans are currently under consideration across the bay in Oakland and in Somerville, Mass., outside of Boston. American Airlines pilots pressed Boeing last fall to make changes to the 737 Max after a deadly crash in October. But the company insisted that pilots would be able to handle the problems, David Gelles and Natalie Kitroeff of the NYT report, citing a recording of an hourlong meeting. • “Michael Michaelis, an American pilot, argued that Boeing should push the F.A.A. to issue what is known as an emergency airworthiness directive.” • “Such a procedure would have required Boeing and airlines in the United States to take immediate action to ensure the safety of the Max, and would have likely taken the jet out of service temporarily.” • “Mike Sinnett, a vice president at Boeing, acknowledged that the manufacturer was assessing potential design flaws with the plane, including new anti-stall software.” • “But he balked at taking a more aggressive approach, saying it was not yet clear that the new system was to blame for the Lion Air crash, which killed 189 people.” • “Less than four months later, an Ethiopian Airlines flight crashed, killing all 157 people on board. The flawed anti-stall system played a role in both disasters.” Senior F.A.A. officials reportedly didn’t pay enough attention to crucial safety checks of the implicated flight-control system, according to the WSJ, which cited unnamed sources. A preliminary internal report by the regulator found that it overly relied on Boeing’s own assessments of the plane’s software. Expect all these topics to be addressed at a House hearing today. Daniel Elwell, the F.A.A.’s acting administrator, and Robert Sumwalt, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, testify at 10 a.m. Eastern. Here’s some good news for Uber in an otherwise gloomy week: The National Labor Relations Board has concluded that its drivers are contractors, not employees, Noam Scheiber of the NYT writes. • Uber wants to keep workers classified as contractors, because treating them as employees would probably increase its labor costs by 20 to 30 percent, according to industry estimates. • Contractors also “lack the protection given to employees under federal law — and enforced by the labor board — for unionizing and other collective activity, such as protesting the policies of employers.” • The conclusion from the board “makes it extremely difficult for Uber drivers to form a union.” • That will make it harder from them to band together to demand higher pay and better working conditions. The ride-hailing service also had its first positive day of trading, with shares rising 7.7 percent to finish at $39.96 — though that is still 11 percent below Uber’s I.P.O. price. But short sellers think Uber is set to fail, and $768 million of its stock — or about 11.5 percent of available shares — is now held by investors betting against it, according to Bloomberg. Its rival Lyft is faring worse: about 62 percent of its shares are already shorted. (Interestingly, so-called “naked shorting” by underwriters on Uber’s first day of trading couldn’t prop up the company’s share price.) Walt Disney struck a deal yesterday to buy Comcast’s 33 percent stake in Hulu, giving it full control of the streaming service — but not for five years or more, Ed Lee of the NYT reports. Disney will pay at least $5.8 billion, though the ultimate purchase price will be determined by an independent assessment of Hulu’s fair market value. Comcast agreed to continue licensing NBC shows to Hulu through 2024, though it has the option to pull its content after three years. That’s seen as crucial to the future of the service, which began as a joint venture between Disney’s ABC, Comcast’s NBC and Fox. It’s the latest twist in the streaming wars. Disney has promoted its coming online video services, including Disney Plus, as it seeks to battle Netflix. Gaining full control of Hulu, which is growing faster than Netflix in the U.S. and gets its revenue from subscriptions and advertising, would be another weapon in its arsenal. The deal gives both Disney and Comcast what they want, Tara Lachapelle of Bloomberg Opinion argues: Disney gets another streaming service, while Comcast earns “a handsome payout for a business with which it never seemed that enamored.” President Trump could issue an executive order this week that would effectively prohibit U.S. companies from using the Chinese telecom company’s equipment, David Shepardson of Reuters reports, citing unnamed sources. The order would target hardware makers deemed a national security risk, Mr. Shepardson reports. It would bar U.S. telecom companies from using products made by such companies, and direct the Commerce Department to work with other agencies to devise a plan for enforcement. The order wouldn’t mention specific companies or countries. But it’s clearly aimed at Huawei. It would be an about-face for Mr. Trump. The FT points out that in February the president said that he wanted the U.S. to win the 5G race by competition and not by blocking “currently more advanced technology,” which was then interpreted to mean Huawei. Huawei argues that the U.S. isn’t a big market for the company. One of its executives, David Wang, told the FT, “We are a company with global operations. So even with fluctuations in any country, we will still be able to have stable operations.” A new report by the consultancy Strategy& found that a majority of C.E.O. ousters last year weren’t related to financial performance — the first time in nearly 20 years that has happened, Jena McGregor of the WaPo reports. More from the study by Strategy&, which is part of PwC: • “Thirty-nine percent of the 89 forced C.E.O. departures in 2018 were due to ethical misconduct, which the study defines as the removal of a C.E.O. following a scandal or improper conduct.” • “Examples include fraud, bribery, insider trading, environmental disasters, inflated resumes or sexual indiscretions.” • “Meanwhile, 35 percent of ousters in 2018 were a result of poor financial performance and just 13 percent were because of conflicts at the board level or with activist investors that weren’t about financial performance but led to the C.E.O.’s ouster.” The highlight of this week’s Robin Hood annual benefit, which raised $23 million for charity, was undoubtedly Paul Tudor Jones dressing up as Jon Snow from the HBO show “Game of Thrones.” Investec named Ruth Leas as the C.E.O. of its British banking arm, succeeding David van der Walt.

Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning, We start today with Alabama’s move to outlaw almost all abortions. We’re also covering San Francisco’s ban on facial recognition technology, and a record-breaking art sale. The Alabama Senate approved a measure on Tuesday that would almost entirely outlaw abortion. It now moves to the desk of Gov. Kay Ivey, whose Republican colleagues expect her support. Even supporters expect lower courts to block the measure. But it was drafted with exactly that in mind: Its architects hope a fight will prompt the Supreme Court to reconsider Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that recognized a constitutional right to end a pregnancy. The details: The legislation bans abortions at every stage of pregnancy — starting at conception — and criminalizes the procedure for doctors, who could be charged with felonies and face up to 99 years in prison. It includes an exception for cases when the woman’s life is at serious risk, but not for cases of rape or incest. Response: Abortion rights advocates say that the measure would drive the procedure underground, endangering the lives of women and girls and disproportionately affecting the poor and minorities. After imposing 25 percent tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods, President Trump said on Tuesday that he was now looking “very strongly” at placing additional levies on nearly every Chinese import. “Our economy is fantastic; theirs is not so good,” he said. Mr. Trump’s measures are putting the U.S., previously a steadfast advocate of global free trade, in an unfamiliar position: It now has the highest tariff rate among developed nations, outranking Canada, Germany, Russia and even China. The American economy is strong, but decreased trade could hurt even sectors that seem unrelated to importing and exporting goods, including research and development, retail, and marketing. Another angle: Despite Beijing’s defiant tone on the trade war with the U.S., some in China argue that the countries benefit more from their economic relationship than either admits. What’s next: Mr. Trump must decide by Friday whether to act on his threat to impose global auto tariffs. European officials would regard such measures as a breach of a tariff truce they worked out with the president last year.  “The Daily”: Today’s episode looks at what the U.S. and China have to lose from the trade war. With an 8-to-1 vote by the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday, the technology hub became the first major American city to block a tool that many police forces are turning to in the search for suspects.  “We have an outsize responsibility to regulate the excesses of technology precisely because they are headquartered here,” said Aaron Peskin, the city official who sponsored the bill. Critics, including a local police officers’ association, say the ban would hinder investigations. The details: The facial recognition fight in San Francisco is largely theoretical. The police department does not currently deploy such technology, and it is in use only at the international airport and at ports that are under federal jurisdiction and are not impacted by the legislation. Go deeper: China uses extensive facial recognition to keep tabs on a largely Muslim minority group.  As the National Rifle Association lavished pay and perks on its leaders and partners, it increasingly relied on its own charity for funds — at least $206 million since 2010, a review of tax records by The Times shows. The charity’s role is among the issues being examined by the New York attorney general in an investigation into the N.R.A.’s tax-exempt status. At issue, experts say, would be whether that money was used for charitable purposes, as required by law, or for political activities. The response: An N.R.A. board member said the lobbying group’s opponents “are trying to paint this false narrative that we’re in deep financial trouble, and I think it’s wishful thinking on their part.” People who walk the Appalachian Trail, above, a 2,190-odd-mile path from Georgia to Maine, are typically a close-knit bunch. But news that one hiker was murdered and another stabbed along a stretch of the trail in Virginia has unnerved the hiking world. Partial embassy evacuation: “Nonemergency” employees were ordered to leave the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad today, after the Trump administration warned of a threat linked to Iran. Sudan breakthrough: Military and civilian leaders agreed today on a transition to democratic rule, a step forward after last month’s ouster of President Omar Hassan al-Bashir. Attack by Yemeni rebels: The Iranian-backed Houthis attacked Saudi oil facilities on Tuesday, a day after Saudi Arabia said two of its oil tankers had been sabotaged at sea. Allies question Iran threat: A British military official said he saw no increased risk from Iran or from Iranian-backed militias in Iraq or Syria, drawing a rebuke from the United States.  Boeing hearing: Lawmakers are set to grill federal regulators today about the safety certification of Boeing’s 737 Max aircraft, which has been grounded after two deadly crashes. Obstruction inquiry: The House Intelligence Committee has opened an investigation into Michael Cohen’s claims that lawyers for President Trump and his family helped shape his false testimony to Congress. Death-penalty drugs: The Justice Department said the Food and Drug Administration lacked the legal authority to regulate drugs used for lethal injections, opening the door for states to import them for executions. Snapshot: Above, an 1890 painting from Claude Monet’s “Meules” series sold for $110.7 million on Tuesday, the most ever for an Impressionist work. In memoriam: Tim Conway, one of Hollywood’s most enduringly popular clowns, died on Tuesday in Los Angeles. He was 85. Late-night comedy: Stephen Colbert mocked President Trump’s claim that the U.S. was engaged in a “little squabble” with China over trade. “We’ve had lots of squabbles throughout history,” he said. “We had World Squabble I, World Squabble II.”  What we’re reading: This essay in The Atlantic. Steven Erlanger, our chief diplomatic correspondent in Europe, recommends its argument that the changing demographics of America help explain the increasing divide between Democrats and Republicans.  Cook: Namoura, a syrup-soaked semolina cake, is a perfect sweet for iftar, after a long day of fasting.  Go: The choreographer and performance artist Ann Liv Young is using her Bushwick apartment — and her daughters and animals — in her version of “Antigone.” Listen: Colin Farrell narrates a new edition of James Joyce’s “A Portrait of the Artist” with coolness and restraint. Smarter Living: We all have moments from our past that gnaw at us — a regret, an unanswered question, hurt feelings. Sometimes revisiting that moment can make things right. It’s never too late to say the thing you’ve been meaning to say. And if you reach out to someone and don’t hear back immediately, don’t assume the worst. And to reduce stress while traveling, plan less. By this time in 1967, 13 days had passed since the Toronto Maple Leafs won the Stanley Cup — a victory that remains the team’s last National Hockey League title. Three years earlier, the Leafs took home the trophy in April. This year, the champions won’t be known until well into June. Several factors keep the N.H.L.’s stars on ice when many sports fans’ thoughts have turned to golf greens. But, like the extended season (it’s gone from 60 regular-season games just after World War II to 82 now), the protracted playoffs mean more ticket and concession sales for teams and more advertising sales for broadcasters. But the playoff economics don’t always work out. After agreeing to pay nearly $5 billion for the N.H.L. rights in Canada — twice what the U.S. market costs NBC — the broadcaster Rogers Communications has been hit by disappointing ratings when, as is the case again this year, the Canadian teams are all out golfing.

These are not ordinary times. The biggest threat to global fortunes has become the intensifying conflict between the two largest economies on earth, the United States and China. As their leaders openly contemplate how to inflict pain on each other, the rest of the world now frets about becoming collateral damage in an escalating trade war. Only a week ago, China and the United States appeared to be moving toward cooling their hostilities, while global economic prospects were improving. Worries about a worldwide slowdown were giving way to burnished hopes for expansion. Fears about the weakening of China’s economy were easing as President Trump advertised a soon-to-be-signed trade deal. That lifted the outlook for Asian economies dependent on global commerce like Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. Europe, a perpetual source of concern, was flashing signs of renewal. Defying skeptics, the American economy remained on a tear. But late last week, as Mr. Trump sharply increased tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, the world found itself grappling with the likelihood that the trade war would be painful and expensive. The concern mounted on Monday as Beijing retaliated and the Trump administration detailed plans to slap 25 percent tariffs on virtually all goods that China sends to the United States. For businesses and consumers alike, it all raised the prospect that they would soon be paying higher prices for goods, a reality that discourages commerce. “An escalation scenario would be terrible all around,” said Gabriel Sterne, head of global macro research at Oxford Economics in London. “A negative impact on trade flow is going to be bad for global growth for several years. It’s bad news for almost everybody.” If both sides follow through on their threatened tariffs, China’s annual economic output will be reduced by 0.8 percent while the United States will see its annual growth reduced by 0.3 percent, according to Oxford Economics. Those numbers are small in the grand scheme of things, but the damage could be felt acutely within industries that are especially exposed to the trade war, such as American agriculture and Chinese electronics manufacturers. The weakness was underscored on Wednesday by the latest indications that China’s economy is slowing and by lower-than-expected figures for retail sales and factory orders in the United States. The harm could be especially severe for countries that are most dependent on trade, including Singapore, Malaysia, Mexico and Japan. At the center of trouble sits China, the world’s most populous country. Its breakneck development over recent decades has added hundreds of millions of consumers to the global marketplace while supplying a vast assemblage of low-cost goods. Given that China is the source of roughly one-third of the world’s economic growth, any disruption to its trade amounts to a global event. Mr. Trump has designed his tariffs to wound China as he seeks to pressure its leaders to agree to cease subsidizing state-owned companies, stop demanding intellectual property from American businesses and open its markets to foreign competitors. Until last week, the president was insisting that a trade deal with China was imminent. Then, he abruptly accused China of reneging on its commitments and opted to increase tariffs. The sharp escalation comes at an especially fraught time for the world economy, jeopardizing what had seemed to be a stabilizing, if gradually slowing, Chinese economy. Volumes of freight imported by China surged in April, according to an analysis of data by UBS, the global investment bank. Worldwide, airfreight was up in March compared with a year earlier, according to the International Air Transport Association. But these trends are fragile. Airfreight has declined nearly 4 percent since its peak in 2017. Outside China, manufacturing in Asia has been slowing for much of the last two years. A trade war between the United States and China — two countries that collectively account for roughly 40 percent of world economic output — would almost certainly aggravate the situation. Exports to China from Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam have plunged by about 14 percent over the past year, or about $6.3 billion, according to analysis from Oxford Economics. Those same countries have lifted their exports to the United States by a similar percentage. But the United States is a less important trading partner, and the increase amounts to less than $2 billion. In Europe, the trade war presents another unwanted source of concern at a time of tenuous progress. Concerns that Britain’s unruly departure from the European Union would damage trade across the Continent had abated — at least in the immediate term — as London and Brussels agreed to extend their fractious divorce proceedings until the end of October. Germany, the Continent’s largest economy, had been moderating fears of weakness, with data showing an increase in factory orders and exports. Germany’s exports to China were up by more than 5 percent in March compared with a year earlier. But much of what Germany sends China amounts to the piece parts of China’s industrial apparatus — car parts, engines, electrical machinery and other gear folded into factory operations. If Chinese factory operations slow in the face of American tariffs, China’s appetite for German goods will probably wane. In Italy and France, industrial activity has been weakening in recent months. “For Europe, it’s happening at a very delicate point in time,” said Kjersti Haugland, chief economist at DNB Markets, an investment bank in Norway. “You have growth being very feeble again.” The trade war has already spooked global stock markets, prompting plunges in share prices in recent days. If investor fear deepens, money will almost certainly flow into the ultimate safe haven, the American dollar. That would probably be accompanied by money leaving so-called emerging markets, exacerbating crises in Argentina and Turkey, while bringing down the value of currencies more broadly, from Brazil to South Africa to India. Falling currencies make imported goods more expensive in those countries, forcing poor people to pay more for food, fuel and transportation. After rising early this year, currencies and stock prices across emerging markets have dipped precipitously in recent weeks. The key question now is how long trade hostilities will endure. It is a question with no clear answer. Mr. Trump appears to be taking resolve from a strong American economy as he declares a willingness to absorb the strains of a drawn-out battle with China. The unemployment rate sits at 3.6 percent, its lowest level in half a century. The economy expanded at a 3.2 percent annual clip during the first three months of the year. Mr. Trump has declared that the United States can win a trade war if it stays the course. Yet he has also used Twitter to complain that the Federal Reserve is not cutting interest rates while China’s leaders stimulate their economy with injections of credit. Perhaps that represents his lobbying for lower rates. It can also be read as an admission that Mr. Trump lacks — and covets — tools possessed by his adversaries in Beijing, who enjoy domination of the levers of policy. Mr. Trump’s strategy appears to be stoking nationalist anger in China, where the Communist Party government leans heavily on such sentiments for propaganda purposes. That could harden China’s willingness to hold its position, as its leaders fear the consequences of gratifying an attack from the American leader. It is not a recipe for expanded global trade, which grew by about 4 percent in 2017, then slowed to 2 percent last year and may contract this year. “Once growth in trade volumes turns negative, it makes us all have to take a closer look at some sort of recession scenario,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, global chief economist at Indosuez Wealth Management in Geneva. “Things are looking more disconcerting for sure. The downside risks are increasing.”"

If you’re interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox. President Trump on Tuesday minimized  the current trade war with China, referring to the clash as a “little squabble.” Late night joked that Trump surely wasn’t clear on the meaning of the phrase. “[Impersonating Trump] We’ve had lots of squabbles throughout history. We had World Squabble I, World Squabble II.” — STEPHEN COLBERT ”[As Trump] I love squabble! When I play squabble, I spell all the best words.” — JIMMY FALLON Colbert also found it hilarious that Trump said he hoped China would “continue to buy our farm product.” “Did he say ‘farm product?’ I’m not sure he knows what grows on farms. [As Trump ] ‘You know, farm product. Amber waves of the brown grass stuff, the noncarbonated white cow cola, and the green thing you take off the burger.’” — STEPHEN COLBERT While campaigning in New Hampshire on Tuesday, Joe Biden talked of plans for a post-Trump White House. He predicted “an epiphany” among many of his Republicans friends. Seth Meyers dedicated a segment that he calls “Hey!” to Biden’s statements. “Hey, Joe — you think Republicans are suddenly going to change their tune and start working with Democrats? Were you asleep during the Obama years? Oh, wait, you were.” — SETH MEYERS “Hey, Joe — I appreciate that you want a normal government that gets things done in a bipartisan fashion. I think most people do. But right now the government is like a pizzeria where half of the employees think there should be more toppings, and the other half doesn’t think pizza is real.” — SETH MEYERS “Yesterday, China retaliated with tariffs on $60 billion of American products, including beer, wine and swimsuits, explaining the new MTV show ‘Spring Break Shanghai: Sober and Naked.’” — STEPHEN COLBERT “To stop paying tariffs, all you have to do is stop using products made in China. That’s going to be awkward for Trump. He’s going to have to stop using his own ties and his hair, I’m guessing.” — STEPHEN COLBERT “I read that China already raised tariffs on wine, hair gel, swimsuits and condoms. That might not affect you, but it’s going to cripple the ‘Bachelor’ mansion.” — JIMMY FALLON After years of parodying Keith Morrison on “Saturday Night Live,” Bill Hader finally met the iconic “Dateline” host while promoting his series “Barry.” Hader shared the news and some pics while chatting with Meyers on Tuesday night. Margo Martindale will drop by “Late Night With Seth Meyers,” where she’ll be chatting about Season 3 of Amazon’s “Sneaky Pete” and potentially offering tidbits on her newly announced role as Bella Abzug, the trailblazing congresswomen, in the forthcoming FX mini-series “Mrs. America.” Children’s programming has long shared messages of individuality and self-empowerment, but it has been behind on the L.G.B.T. front. Case in point: It took 22 seasons before PBS’s animated series “Arthur” revealed one of its existing characters as gay. On the season premiere this Monday, Arthur’s third-grade teacher, Mr. Ratburn, married his male partner, Patrick. As one character says, “It’s a brand-new world.”"
