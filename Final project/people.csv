	BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Since they were launched in February 2018, the economic and trade consultations have come a long way with China and the US agreeing on most parts of the deal. But the consultations have not been free of setbacks, each of them being the result of a US breach of consensus and commitments, and backtracking, according to a white paper released Sunday.

	In response to the economic and trade friction started by the US, China has been forced to take countermeasures, as bilateral trade and investment relations took a hit. For the well-being of the Chinese and American people and the economic development of the two countries, both sides deemed it necessary to come to the negotiating table to seek a solution through consultation, said the white paper titled China's Position on the China-US Economic and Trade Consultations, released by the State Council Information Office.

	China had advocated resolving economic and trade friction through negotiation and consultation from the start. In early February 2018, the US government expressed the wish that China could send a high-level delegation to the US to engage in economic and trade consultation.

	Demonstrating great goodwill and positive efforts, China held several rounds of high-level economic and trade consultations with the US, characterized by in-depth exchanges of views on trade imbalance among other major issues. The two sides made substantial progress as they reached preliminary consensus on expanding China's imports of agricultural and energy products from the US. However, on March 22, 2018, the US government unveiled the so-called Report on Section 301 Investigation of China, falsely accusing China of ""IP theft"" and ""forced technology transfer,"" and subsequently announced an additional tariff of 25 percent on US$50 billion of Chinese exports to the US, according to the white paper.

	Taking a big-picture view of the bilateral relationship, the Chinese government sent a working team again to the US to engage in genuine consultations. On May 19, 2018, China and the US issued a joint statement, agreeing to refrain from fighting a trade war, to continue high-level communications, and to actively seek solutions to respective economic and trade concerns. The US publicly announced that it would suspend the plan for additional tariffs on Chinese goods. On May 29, 2018, despite the opposition of its domestic business community and the general public, the US administration tore up the consensus just ten days after the joint statement, gratuitously criticizing China's economic system and trade policy, while announcing the resumption of the tariff program. Starting from early July 2018, in three steps, the US imposed additional tariffs of 25 percent on Chinese exports worth US$50 billion, and additional tariffs of 10 percent on US$200 billion of Chinese exports, which, according to the US, would be raised to 25 percent on January 1, 2019.

	In addition, the US threatened further tariffs on all remaining Chinese exports, leading to quick escalation of the economic and trade friction between the two countries. In defense of its national dignity and its people's interests, China had to respond in kind and raised tariffs on imports worth US$110 billion from the US.

	On November 1, 2018, US President Donald Trump had a telephone conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping and proposed a summit meeting. On December 1 the two presidents had a meeting on the margins of the G20 Summit in Argentina. In accordance with their important consensus on economic and trade issues, the two sides agreed to halt new additional tariffs for 90 days to allow for intensive talks geared toward the full elimination of all additional tariffs. In the ensuing 90 days, the working teams of China and the US held three rounds of high-level consultations in Beijing and Washington D.C., reaching preliminary consensus on many matters of principle for the China-US economic and trade deal. On February 25, 2019, the US announced the postponement of the additional tariffs scheduled for March 1 on US$200 billion of Chinese exports to the US. From late March to early April, the working teams of the two countries held another three rounds of high-level consultations and made substantial progress.

	Following numerous rounds of consultations, the two countries had agreed on most of the issues. Regarding the remaining issues, the Chinese government urged mutual understanding and compromise for solutions to be found, the white paper said.

	But the more the US government is offered, the more it wants. Resorting to intimidation and coercion, it persisted with exorbitant demands, maintained the additional tariffs imposed since the friction began, and insisted on including mandatory requirements concerning China's sovereign affairs in the deal, which only served to delay the resolution of remaining differences. On May 6, 2019, the US irresponsibly accused China of backtracking on its position to shift the blame for the inconclusive talks onto China. Despite China's fierce opposition, the US raised the additional tariffs on US$200 billion of Chinese exports to the US from 10 percent to 25 percent, which represented a serious setback to the economic and trade consultations. On May 13 the US announced that it had launched procedures to slap additional tariffs on remaining Chinese goods, which are worth around US$300 billion.

	These acts contradicted the agreement reached by the two presidents to ease friction through consultation -- and the expectations of people around the world -- casting a shadow over the bilateral economic and trade consultations and world economic growth. In defense of its own interests, China had to take tariff measures in response, the white paper said.

	BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- China and the US are each other's largest trading partner and important source of investment, and their commercial cooperation has brought substantial benefits to both countries and both peoples, according to a white paper titled China's Position on the China-US Economic and Trade Consultations released by the State Council Information Office on Sunday.

	In 2018, bilateral trade in goods and services exceeded US$750 billion, and two-way direct investment approached US$160 billion, the white paper said.

	According to China Customs, the trade in goods between China and the US grew from less than US$2.5 billion in 1979 when the two countries forged diplomatic ties to US$633.5 billion in 2018, a 252-fold increase. In 2018, the US was China's largest trading partner and export market, and the sixth largest source of imports. According to the US Department of Commerce, in 2018 China was the largest trading partner of the US, its third largest export market, and its largest source of imports. China is the key export market for US airplanes, soybeans, automobiles, integrated circuits and cotton. During the ten years from 2009 to 2018, China was one of the fastest growing export markets for American goods, with an annual average increase of 6.3 percent and an aggregate growth of 73.2 percent, higher than the average growth of 56.9 percent represented by other regions in the world, the white paper said.

	Trade in services between China and the US is flourishing and highly complementary. The two countries have conducted extensive, in-depth, and mutually-beneficial cooperation in tourism, culture, and intellectual property. China is the largest destination for US tourists in the Asia-Pacific and the US is the largest overseas destination for Chinese students. According to Chinese figures, two-way trade in services rose from US$27.4 billion in 2006, the earliest year with available statistics, to US$125.3 billion in 2018, a 3.6-fold increase. In 2018, China's services trade deficit with the US reached US$48.5 billion.

	Over the past forty years, two-way investment between China and the US has grown from near zero to approximately US$160 billion, and this cooperation has proved fruitful. According to MOFCOM, by the end of 2018 accumulative Chinese business direct investment in the US exceeded US$73.17 billion. The rapid growth of Chinese business investment in the US has contributed to local economic growth, job creation, and tax revenues. According to MOFCOM, the paid-in investment by the US in China was US$85.19 billion by the end of 2018. In 2017, the total annual sales revenues of US-invested companies in China were US$700 billion, with profits exceeding US$50 billion.

	Therefore, if trade in goods and services as well as two-way investment are taken into account, China-US trade and economic relations are mutually beneficial, rather than the US ""being taken advantage of"", the white paper said.

	BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Economic globalization is a firmly-established trend of the times, and beggar-thy-neighbor unilateralism and protectionism are unpopular, according to a white paper titled China's Position on the China-US Economic and Trade Consultations issued by the State Council Information Office on Sunday.

	The trade protectionist measures taken by the US go against the WTO rules, damage the multilateral trading system, seriously disrupt global industrial chains and supply chains, undermine market confidence, and pose a serious challenge to global economic recovery and a major threat to the trend of economic globalization, the white paper said.

	The US measures are undermining the authority of the multilateral trading system. The US has launched a series of unilateral investigations, including those under Sections 201, 232 and 301, and imposed tariff measures. These are a serious breach of the most fundamental and central WTO rules, including most-favored-nation treatment and tariff binding. Such unilateralist and protectionist actions have harmed the interests of China and other WTO members. More importantly, they have undermined the authority of the WTO and its dispute settlement system, and exposed the multilateral trading system and international trade order to peril, the white paper said.

	The US measures threaten global economic growth. With the shadow of the international financial crisis still lingering over the global economy, the US government has escalated economic and trade friction and hiked additional tariffs, provoking corresponding measures by the countries involved. This disrupts global economic and trade order, dampens world economic recovery, and undermines the development of companies and the well-being of people in all countries, plunging the world economy into the ""recession trap,"" according to the white paper.

	Global Economic Prospects released by the World Bank in January 2019 revised its forecast for global economic growth down further to 2.9 percent, citing continuous trade friction as a major downward risk. The International Monetary Fund also marked down its projection of world economic growth for 2019 to 3.3 percent from the 2018 estimate of 3.6 percent in its World Economic Outlook report published in April 2019, suggesting that economic and trade friction could further depress global economic growth and weaken already anemic investment.

	The US moves disrupt global industrial and supply chains. China and the US are both key links in global industrial and supply chains. Given the large volume of intermediary goods and components from other countries in Chinese end-products exported to the US, US tariff hikes will hurt all the multinationals -- not least those from the US -- that work with Chinese companies. The tariff measures artificially drive up the costs of supply chains, and undermine their stability and security. As a result, some businesses are forced to readjust their global supply chains at the expense of optimal resource allocation, the white paper said.

	It is foreseeable that the latest US tariff hikes on China, far from resolving issues, will only make things worse for all sides. China stands firm in opposition. Recently, the US administration imposed ""long-arm jurisdiction"" and sanctions against Huawei and other Chinese companies on the fabricated basis of national security, to which China is also firmly opposed, according to the white paper.

	BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Accusing China of stealing intellectual property to support its own development is an unfounded fabrication, according to a white paper titled China's Position on the China-US Economic and Trade Consultations released by the State Council Information Office on Sunday.

	Historical records confirm that China's achievements in scientific and technological innovation are not something we stole or forcibly took from others; they were earned through self-reliance and hard work, the white paper said.

	China has established a legal system for the protection of intellectual property that is consistent with prevailing international rules and adapted to China's domestic conditions. The understanding of the importance of intellectual property among the general public and business community in China has increased, the value of royalties paid to foreign rights-holders has risen significantly, and the number of intellectual property applications and registrations has surged, said the white paper.

	Former WIPO Director General Arpad Bogsch spoke highly of China's legal framework for intellectual property protection, noting that China's achievements are ""unmatched in the history of intellectual property protection.""

	The US Chamber of Commerce recognized that China is making concrete progress in creating an intellectual property environment appropriate to the 21st century.

	In its 2018 China Business Climate Survey Report, the American Chamber of Commerce in China noted that among the main challenges facing its member companies operating in China, concern over intellectual property dropped from 5th place in 2011 to 12th place in 2018.

	An article in The Diplomat predicted that China will become a leader in global intellectual property. Many of the concerns raised by foreign firms doing business in China have already been addressed through judicial reform and a strengthened enforcement mechanism, according to the white paper.

	In terms of some key innovation indices, China is already among the world's leading players, the white paper said.

	In 2017, total R&D investment in China reached RMB 1.76 trillion, ranking second in the world. The number of patent applications reached 1.382 million, ranking No. 1 in the world for the seventh consecutive year. The number of invention patents granted reached 327,000, up by 8.2 percent year-on-year. China ranks third in the world in terms of valid invention patents held, the white paper noted.

	China's economic development has benefited from international technology transfer and dissemination. International holders of technology have also reaped enormous benefits from this process, said the white paper.

	China encourages and respects voluntary technical cooperation between Chinese and foreign firms based on market principles. It strongly opposes forced technology transfer and takes resolute action against intellectual property infringement. Accusations against China of forced technology transfer are baseless and untenable, the document noted.

	BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The China-US economic and trade friction provoked by the United States damages the interests of both countries and of the wider world, according to a white paper titled China's Position on the China-US Economic and Trade Consultations issued by the State Council Information Office on Sunday.

	Trumpeting ""America First,"" the current US administration has adopted a series of unilateral and protectionist measures, regularly wielded tariffs as a ""big stick"" and coerced other countries into accepting its demands. The US has initiated frequent investigations under the long-unused Sections 201 and 232 against its main trading partners, causing disruption to the global economic and trade landscape. Specifically targeting China, in August 2017, it launched a unilateral investigation under Section 301. Turning a blind eye to China's unremitting efforts and remarkable progress in protecting intellectual property and improving the business environment for foreign investors, the US issued a myriad of slanted and negative observations, and imposed additional tariffs and investment restrictions on China, provoking economic and trade friction between the two countries, said the white paper.

	Turning a blind eye to the nature of the economic structure and the stage of development in China and the US, as well as the reality of the international industrial division of labor, the US insists that China's ""unfair"" and ""non-reciprocal"" trade policies have created a trade deficit in bilateral commercial exchanges that constitutes ""being taken advantage of,"" leading to unilateral imposition of additional tariffs on China. In fact, in today's globalized world, the Chinese and American economies are highly integrated and together constitute an entire industrial chain. The two economies are bound in a union that is mutually beneficial and win-win in nature. Equating a trade deficit to being taken advantage of is an error. The restrictive measures the US has imposed on China are not good for China or the US, and still worse for the rest of the world.

	BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The US administration has imposed additional tariffs on Chinese goods exported to the US, impeding two-way trade and investment cooperation and undermining market confidence and economic stability in the two countries and globally, according to a white paper titled China's Position on the China-US Economic and Trade Consultations issued by the State Council Information Office on Sunday.

	The US tariff measures lead to a decrease in the volume of China's export to the US, which fell by 9.7 percent year-on-year in the first four months of 2019, dropping for five months in a row, the white paper said, citing data from the website of China's General Administration of Customs.

	In addition, as China has to impose tariffs as a countermeasure to US tariff hikes, US exports to China have dropped for eight months in a row.

	The white paper said that the uncertainty brought by US-China economic and trade friction made companies in both countries more hesitant about investing. China's investment in the US continues to fall and the growth rate of US investment in China has also slowed down.

	Direct investment by Chinese companies in the US was US$5.79 billion in 2018, down by 10 percent year-on-year, the white paper said, citing data from the Ministry of Commerce (MOC).

	In 2018, paid-in US investment in China was US$2.69 billion, up by only 1.5 percent year-on-year, compared with an increase of 11 percent in 2017.

	With the outlook for China-US trade friction unclear, the WTO has lowered its forecast for global trade growth in 2019 from 3.7 percent to 2.6 percent, the white paper said, citing a WTO trade forecasts report on its website.

	BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The China-US commercial relationship serves as both the ballast and the propeller of the overall bilateral relationship. At stake are the fundamental interests of the two peoples, and the prosperity and stability of the world, according to a white paper released Sunday by the State Council Information Office.

	Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the US, bilateral trade and economic relations have come a long way, with expanding fields of cooperation at higher levels. A mutually beneficial and win-win relationship with strong complementarity and interlinked interests has been forged, benefiting not only the two countries but also the entire world, according to the white paper titled China's Position on the China-US Economic and Trade Consultations.

	Given the differences in stage of development and economic system, it is inevitable that the two countries will experience differences and friction in their commercial cooperation. The history of China-US trade and economic relations has seen twists and turns and difficult situations. By adopting a rational and cooperative attitude, the two countries have managed to resolve previous conflicts, bridge differences, and render the bilateral commercial relationship more mature through dialogue and consultation.

	Since it took office in 2017, the new US administration has threatened additional tariffs and other measures and provoked frequent economic and trade friction with its major trading partners. In response to the economic and trade friction unilaterally initiated by the US since March 2018, China has had to take forceful measures to defend the interests of the nation and its people, the white paper noted.

	At the same time, committed to resolving disputes through dialogue and consultation, China has engaged in multiple rounds of economic and trade consultations with the US in an effort to stabilize the bilateral commercial relationship. China's position has been consistent and clear - that cooperation serves the interests of the two countries, that conflict can only hurt both, and that cooperation is the only correct choice for both sides, it said.

	Concerning their differences and frictions on the economic and trade front, China is willing to work together with the US to find solutions, and to reach a mutually beneficial and win-win agreement. However, cooperation has to be based on principles. There are bottom lines in consultations. China will not compromise on major issues of principle. China does not want a trade war, but it is not afraid of one and it will fight one if necessary. China's position on this has never changed, the white paper pointed out.

	The white paper was issued by the Chinese government to provide a comprehensive picture of the China-US economic and trade consultations, and present China's policy position on these consultations.

	BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Cooperation between China and the United States on technological innovation and high-tech can be highly complementary and mutually-beneficial, and both sides can enhance competitiveness in the long run, according to Chinese trade experts at a seminar.

	It is a false view that China is the only party benefiting from the bilateral technological and high-tech cooperation, said Zhang Xiaoqiang, executive deputy head of the China Center for International Economic Exchanges (CCIEE).

	Organized by the CCIEE on Friday, the seminar was attended by former officials and representatives from business sectors.

	""For example, U.S. semiconductor giant Qualcomm and Micron have seen over half of their sales revenue coming from Chinese market while the figure for Texas Instruments and Intel is one-third,"" said Zhang, also the former deputy director of the National Development and Reform Commission.

	Meanwhile, Apple and Hewlett Packard's largest assembly and manufacturing bases are also located in China where they have sold a large number of their products, Zhang said. These companies have all benefited from the dividends of China's development.

	Commenting on recent U.S. moves to escalate trade disputes, Zeng Peiyan, chairman of the CCIEE said a cold-war mentality, unilateralism and a zero-sum games were outdated things and not conducive to solving problems.

	""The U.S. trade bullying will seriously damage global scientific and technological exchanges and industrial development"", said Wang Chunzheng, former head of the Office of the Central Leading Group on Financial and Economic Affairs.

	""The spillover effects accumulated over the years in the process of international technological cooperation, which have been proved effective, will be lowered, resulting in immeasurable losses to China and the United States as well as people across the globe,"" he said.

	Ma Xiuhong, former vice commerce minister said that the U.S.-invoked trade disputes and escalating behaviours had apparently curbed the sound momentum of Sino-U.S. two-way investments, causing adverse impact on enterprises of both countries.

	However, China is capable of strengthening basic research, striving for breakthroughs in core technology and enhancing competitiveness of its high-tech industry, Zhang said.

	""Chinese economy has great resilience, huge potential and room for manoeuvres in coping with external challenges, and the U.S. suppression would be in vain,"" Zeng said, calling on the U.S. side to return to rationality on its policy toward China and show sincerity to solve the problems.

	BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States remains an important export market for China, but with decreasing significance, according to China's vice commerce minister.

	The U.S. tariff hike will have some impact on China's foreign trade, but is generally controllable, Wang Shouwen said in an interview Friday, citing the waning role of the United States as an export market and the rising share of emerging export markets including the Belt and Road region and emerging markets.

	""The U.S. market accounted for about 22 percent of China's total exports in 1999, but the share shrinks to about 16 percent now,"" he said.

	China has about 400,000 export firms, with private enterprises taking up half of the total export and high-tech exports playing bigger roles, according to Wang.

	""China's foreign trade has weathered storms during the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and the global financial crisis in 2008. History proves that China's foreign trade has huge growth potential, and we are confident in seeking progress while keeping the market stable and achieving high-quality development,"" Wang said.

	BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. additional tariffs on Chinese products have limited impact on China's foreign investment inflow, according to the Ministry of Commerce (MOC).

	U.S. investment took a tiny share of China's total foreign direct investment, which only stood at about 4.2 percent by the end of 2018, Chinese vice commerce minister Wang Shouwen said in an interview Friday.

	China, on the other hand, has huge market appeal thanks to its large scale and a growing middle-income community. China's social retail sales are catching up with the United States, Wang said.

	The U.S. tariff hike has limited impact on foreign enterprises which seek long-term growth and need the Chinese market, he said, adding they are upbeat on development opportunities as the huge market grows with sound economic fundamentals.

	Wang said there were cases of some export-oriented and labor-intensive foreign enterprises transfering production capacity overseas, but they only made up a limited share.

	Transfering production capacity might reduce some costs, but could also face other uncertainties in terms of local industrial development, economic environment, labor quality as well as risks of U.S. trade restriction measures, Wang said.

	Foreign firms enjoy good opportunities and a rosy future for cooperation and development in China as China will continue to expand market access and improve business environment, he said.

	The 2019 China International Fair for Trade in Services (CIFTIS) opened on May 28 in Beijing, continuing to promote China’s international service trade as the country pursues greater opening-up.

	The CIFTIS, which was named China (Beijing) International Fair for Trade in Services, has a new name this year.

	Under the theme of “openness, innovation, intelligence and integration”, the 2019 CIFTIS has an exhibition area of 165,000 square meters, and will hold 246 forums, conferences and business talks to explore opportunities brought about by service trade for global economic development.

	Reports confirm that the event attracts 7,998 companies and institutions, including 614 transnational corporations and famous companies in service trade, and 63 companies in the Fortune Global 500 list.

	Data showed that China further trimmed its negative list for foreign investment to loosen market entrance for foreign investors in 2018, and the data also showed that China utilized $91.9 billion of foreign investment in the service sector, accounting for 68.1 percent of the country’s total utilized foreign investment.

	China continues to open up the service sector, which is an important action for the country to pursue a new round of high-level opening-up, Chinese Minister of Commerce Zhong Shan said at the opening ceremony of the event.

	BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Given China's well-designed economic plan, unswerving pursuit of high-quality development, and consistent opening-up, the Chinese economy will come through the challenges and risks brought by the trade war.

	The United States has unilaterally escalated the situation, based on groundless accusations and unreasonable suspicions. However, faced with pressure from the United States, China's economy has enough confidence and resilience to defend itself.

	Upholding a new vision for development, China has been highlighting innovative, coordinated, green, open and inclusive approaches in its economic development with emerging driving forces to keep steady economic growth.

	For instance, China has been shifting its growth model to one relying more on consumption, which has contributed over 75 percent of China's GDP growth.

	A total of 195 million domestic tourist trips were made during this year's four-day May Day holiday, which shows the consumption potential of China's market.

	China's shift in the economic structure not only shields the country from the external challenges but also provides opportunities for the economies that are willing to cooperate fairly with China.

	Those who expect a heavy blow to China's economy from the trade war will be disappointed to see that external pressure will fail to shake the country's sound economic fundamentals.

	Thriving high-tech industries also added to China's resilience. Considering that the country has abundant industrial raw materials in store, there is enormous potential for China to develop high-end manufacturing industries.

	By heavily investing in technological innovation, the city of Baotou, north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, has upgraded its rare earth processing industries. Instead of selling the materials at low prices, the city, home to over 80 percent of China's rare earth resources, can benefit far more from high-tech products made from rare earth.

	In sharp contrast to the United States' protectionist moves, China has adhered to opening up to foreign investors, who have voiced their confidence in China. More than 13,000 foreign-invested enterprises were set up in China during the first four months this year.

	It is worth noting that during the period, investment from the United States has increased by 24.3 percent year on year. The U.S. companies, whom the U.S. government claimed to protect, have made their stance clear.

	The hard times caused by the trade war will not last forever, as with solid internal growth momentum and broad confidence from the outside, China will withstand any challenge and eventually triumph over trade bullying from the United States.

	WASHINGTON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.S.-initiated tariff conflict with China will substantially diminish investment and undermine productivity growth if staying in place for longer, experts from a Washington-based think tank have said.

	Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE), said at a press briefing on Tuesday that if the United States goes full out on the tariffs, the direct impact would be overall increases in inflation, with low income households hit harder than others.

	Despite an expected drag on growth, Posen, drawing on works by his colleagues, said the impact of additional tariffs could be partially offset by fiscal or monetary measures in both countries, so the direct effects are ""meaningful but not huge.""

	However, in the medium term, the effects on investment and productivity growth are ""substantial,"" he said.

	""Removing the attractiveness of foreign direct investment not just in supply chains but in branded goods and in business services ... is significant,"" Posen said.

	In the long run, Posen said, ""you can end up with a very substantial disruption to the most productive parts of the U.S. economy for a couple of years.""

	Nicholas Lardy, a senior fellow at the think tank, said he does not see a significant impact on China's GDP growth this year.

	Lardy, who has written several books on the Chinese economy, said it would probably be ""not so smart"" for companies to massively move supply chains away from China, because it would be difficult to find a place that could ""absorb that big an increase.""

	In addition to economic impact, Posen said the United States, by imposing tariffs, has sent a ""disruptive"" message to China and other countries, which could ""divide the world"" on important issues.

	The group of experts, who visited China earlier this month, are also concerned about increased frictions on the investment and high tech fronts.

	""The broader tech conflict is much more harmful on the engine of the U.S. economy,"" Posen said, noting that the U.S. administration's ""broad export control regime"" would likely impede cross border technology flows.

	Such frictions may also make it harder for the United States and China to close a deal, as the depth of mistrust is growing, said Jeffrey Schott, a senior fellow at the PIIE.

	""Clearly we are much further away from a deal than we were at the end of April,"" he said, yet adding that he does not think ""the door is shut.""

	BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Whether or not China and the United States can make progress in their trade negotiations largely depends on the attitude and sincerity of the U.S. side, said China's Ministry of Commerce (MOC) on Thursday.

	The consultations can continue only on the basis of equality and mutual respect, MOC spokesperson Gao Feng said at a press conference.

	The wrong practice by the U.S. side of escalating trade frictions and spreading them to other fields has seriously damaged the basis and atmosphere of the consultations, Gao said, noting that ""the responsibility lies entirely with the U.S. side.""

	As for some recent remarks made by the U.S. on the negotiations, Gao said that the information from the U.S. side has been somewhat inconsistent, which called into question its sincerity.

	Gao said that China has always believed that cooperation is the only correct choice for China and the United States.

	There are principles for cooperation and a bottom line for consultation, he said.

	""The Chinese side will never accept any agreement that undermines national sovereignty and dignity. China will never give in on major issues of principle,"" Gao said.

	If an agreement is to be reached, the U.S. side needs to show its sincerity, properly address the core concerns raised by the Chinese side and continue consultations on the basis of equality and mutual respect, he said.

	A US tariff on China-made photovoltaic (PV) power products will have little effect on the nation’s PV industry thanks to an expanding domestic market and robust global demand, experts said.

	On May 9, the US announced a 25 percent tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, including PV products. However, Chinese observers said that the industry will remain strong despite the tariff, as the US only represents a small fraction of China’s PV exports, and China has already established other markets with strong demand.

	In the first four months of this year, China’s exports of PV products rose 81 percent year-on-year to 20.6 gigawatts (GW), according to a report released by the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Machinery and Electronic Products (CCCME). According to the report, the biggest export markets included the Netherlands, Vietnam, India and Australia.

	“Due to anti-dumping and countervailing sanctions imposed by the US, the US market has been contracting for Chinese PV exports in recent years,” Lin Boqiang, director of the China Center for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University, told the Global Times, “Also, US’s demand for PV products has always been relatively weak because of its supply of cheap natural gas.”

	The US began imposing anti-dumping and countervailing duties on Chinese PV products since 2011 and trade volume has declined ever since. In 2018, only 61 megawatts of PV modules were exported to the US, according to CCCME.

	Lin also said that because of the duties in the US, a good number of Chinese PV companies that targeted the US market have shifted manufacturing to other countries including Southeast Asian and European countries to avoid US sanctions.

	The boom in PV exports in the first four months is also thanks to the termination of anti-dumping and countervailing sanctions in the EU, which has become the biggest export market for China, Lin said.

	According to a report by the CCCME, free trade of PV products between China and the EU resumed in September 2018, and bilateral trade volume doubled in the following quarter. The shift in the EU contributed 3.54 GW to China’s total PV exports in the first quarter increasing 957.7 percent year-on-year.

	“The EU has a growing demand for PV products because it has one of the highest environmental standards in the world,” Lin said. “Likewise the domestic market for PV models is also growing. One can predict China’s PV export market will continue its robust growth in the coming years.”

	BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- China hopes the United States will respect facts and market laws, and refrain from politicizing the issue of currency exchange rates, a Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Wednesday.

	""China has repeatedly advised the U.S. to act according to multilateral international rules instead of unilaterally assessing other countries' currency exchange rates,"" spokesperson Lu Kang said at a daily press briefing.

	Lu's comments came after the U.S. Treasury Department said on Tuesday that no major trading partner of the U.S., including China, met the standard of currency manipulation, though it put China, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam on its ""monitoring list.""

	""Whether a country manipulates its currency or not, is not decided by the United States,"" Lu said, adding that international institutions had authoritative evaluations on the exchanges rates of countries around the world.

	China will steadfastly deepen the market-oriented reform of its currency exchange rate, continue to improve the floating exchange rate system based on the market supply and demand and with reference to a basket of currencies, and work to keep the renminbi exchange rate basically stable, reasonable and balanced, Lu said.

	Shares of China's rare earth-related firms rallied significantly on Wednesday after China indicated that it may use the minerals as powerful weapons against the US amid an escalating trade war between the world's two largest economies.

	Hong Kong-listed shares of China Rare Earth Holdings Ltd soared by more than 30 percent in morning trading, while JL MAG Rare-Earth Co Ltd, rose by the daily 10-percent limit to a record high. China Northern rose by 8.68 percent as of close on Wednesday.

	On Tuesday night, a spokesperson from the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), China's top planner, said, ""You asked whether rare earths will become China's countermeasures against the US. What I can tell you is that if anyone wants to use products made of China's rare-earth exports to contain China's development, the people of Ganzhou and across China will not be happy with that.""

	The comment was viewed by many as a signal that China might use its rare earths as a weapon to contain the US as trade tensions between the two intensified.

	The People's Daily also published an editorial on Wednesday, emphasizing that the US shouldn't ""underestimate China's ability to fight the trade war."" The statement is deemed by the analysts as a clear-cut warning that China's rare earths will be used as a weapon.

	China dominates global supply chains. The country accounted for at least 71 percent of mined output last year, with the percentage for processed rare earth compounds even higher, and the US sourced 80 percent of its rare earth imports from China from 2014 to 2017, according to statistics from the US government.

	Rare earth minerals are a group of 17 elements used in production in a huge number of sectors, including oil refining, electronics, and the glass industry. It is vital for many US industries.

	On May 20, Chinese President Xi Jinping visited JL MAG Rare-Earth Co, a Ganzhou-based high-tech company specializing in research and development (R&D) on permanent rare-earth magnetic materials, to learn about the company's operations and the development of the rare earth industry, the Xinhua News Agency reported.

	Huawei Technologies Co filed a motion for summary judgment on Wednesday Beijing time, as the Chinese tech company aims to speed up its lawsuit against the US government over a ban that bars federal agencies from using its products.

	The Chinese tech heavyweight asked a court in Plano, Texas, where it filed the case, to declare the US ban on its products unconstitutional. It also called on the US government to halt its state-sanctioned campaign against Huawei over alleged cybersecurity fears.

	Banning Huawei using cybersecurity as an excuse ""will do nothing to make networks more secure. It provides a false sense of security, and distracts attention from the real challenges we face,"" said Song Liuping, Huawei's chief legal officer. The company sued the US government in March.

	""The US government has provided no evidence to show that Huawei is a security threat. There is no gun, no smoke. Only speculation,"" Song added.

	The US has launched a crackdown on Huawei, including adding the Chinese company to a trade blacklist which banned Huawei from accessing any US technologies without special approval. It accused the company of posing risks to its national security. Huawei has repeatedly denied the accusations and said these charges were not supported by any factual evidence.

	Song also said adding Huawei to the trade blacklist ""sets a dangerous precedent. Today, it is telecoms and Huawei. Tomorrow, it could be your industry, your company, your consumers,"" he said.

	Huawei filed the lawsuit against the US government in a district court in Plano, Texas, where Huawei has its American headquarters. Huawei said that part of the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act is unconstitutional because it singles out Huawei. The act bans government agencies from contracting with Huawei or companies that use the company's equipment.

	WASHINGTON, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Treasury Department said on Tuesday that no major trading partner of the United States meets the standard of currency manipulation.

	In its Semiannual Report on International Economic and Exchange Rate Policies to the U.S. Congress, the Treasury Department concluded that no major U.S. trading partner met the criteria to be labeled as a currency manipulator during the four quarters ending December 2018.

	However, it put China, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam on its ""monitoring list,"" which means foreign exchange policies of these countries will bear close attention of the U.S. government.

	The Treasury Department called on China to take necessary steps to avoid ""a persistently weak currency,"" noting that improved economic fundamentals and structural policy settings would underpin a stronger renminbi (RMB) over time.

	Liu Guoqiang, vice governor of the People's Bank of China, said last week that China is ""capable and confident"" of keeping the RMB exchange rate generally stable on a reasonable and balanced level.

	Adam Posen, president of Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, said earlier on Tuesday that it's ""pretty close to absurd"" to accuse China of currency manipulation as China basically has not manipulated the currency for years.

	In the report, the Treasury Department reviewed and assessed the policies of an expanded set of 21 major U.S. trading partners, whose bilateral goods trade with the United States exceeds 40 billion U.S. dollars annually. Previously, it only covered the 12 largest trading partners.

	The department also revised and updated the thresholds it uses to assess where unfair currency practices or imbalanced macroeconomic policies may be emerging.

	As one of the criteria, countries with a current account surplus equivalent to at least 2 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP), down from 3 percent previously, will be labeled as a currency manipulator.

	On May 24, 2019, Ambassador Cui Tiankai had an interview with Bloomberg TV’s Bloomberg Day break: Americas. (Photo from the official website of Embassy of the People’s Republic of China in the United States of America)

	Chinese Ambassador to the US, Cui Tiankai, recently called the Trump administration measures against Huawei “unusual,” among other things.

	“Can the US actually deprive people of the right to benefit from technology? I don’t think so. Does Washington really have the interests of the American people in mind? I don’t think so, either,” Cui said during an exclusive interview with Bloomberg TV.

	Cui stressed for greater Sino-US cooperation, and refuted rumors of a potential China-US “technology war.” Cui questioned the US measures aimed at Huawei under the pretext of national security.

	He also denied suspicions that Americans have supposedly held over the Chinese tech company’s status as a privately-owned entity, indicating there was no evidence of this as it’s been clear Huawei is a privately held company.

	Cui refuted rumors that a “technological war” was imminent between the two countries and stressed that both sides should seek greater cooperation and collaboration with one another.

	

	The term “trade war” is never positive, Cui explained, and added that trade is centered on the idea of mutual benefit and war is a form of mutual destruction.

	Such opposing concepts should never be juxtaposed to create a term or describe a situation.

	With trade negotiations, Cui said an agreement has yet to be reached and remains a work in progress.

	Cui pointed out that in May after both sides reached an agreement and issued a joint statement, it was the US who had a change of heart, and almost overnight.

	Communication should be based on mutual respect and benefit and carried out in a balanced fashion.

	Cui explained the drastic reduction in China’s US investments was the result of the mercurial behavior of the Trump administration. He also added that further restrictions and barriers have dissuaded investors.

	China will do whatever is necessary to protect the legitimate interests of companies like Huawei and all Chinese in the country.

	“The US side can wait and see,” Cui said.

	Should things continue to move in the wrong direction, then a response could be imminent. However, if both countries can find a way to work together and head in the right direction, then things would improve.

	Both heads of state have provided strategic guidance for bilateral relations. And expects the two will be able to reach some sort of conclusion.

	Indicating that China is still willing to deal with the Trump administration, in recent years, as Cui pointed out, some progress has been achieved.

	NEW YORK, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Urban Tea Inc., a retailer of specialty tea and baked goods in China, announced its strategic business plan this week to expand its business to selected overseas markets.

	""The first phase of the plan will focus on the North American market,"" according to a statement from the company. It aims to open its first flagship store in the United States.

	The second phase of the plan is to explore the Southeast Asian market, it said. As many outbound Chinese tourists would bring domestic consumption habits and Chinese tea culture to Southeast Asia, an important destination for Chinese outbound travel, the company believes there is great potential for its products in the area.

	""Through the implementation of the overseas expansion plan, we expect to further expand brand awareness, promote the new Chinese-style tea culture, and promote the 'Freshly made, low-calorie' healthy eating concept,"" said Kan Lu, chief financial officer of the company, which was listed in Nasdaq under the ticker symbol of ""MYT"".

	BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Tariff hikes by the United States will to some extent result in an increase of enterprise operation costs, lower competitiveness and fewer orders, but their impact on China's manufacturing sector is generally controllable, a senior official told Xinhua in an interview.

	The 200 billion U.S. dollars worth of Chinese goods on which the United States imposed additional tariffs accounts for 41.8 percent of China's exports to the country, but only 8 percent of China's total exports, said Wang Zhijun, vice minister of industry and information technology.

	Moreover, about half of the affected enterprises are foreign-funded enterprises, including many American companies, said Wang.

	In other words, the tariff hikes hurt not only the interests of Chinese enterprises and consumers, but also U.S. companies and consumers as well as the global supply chain, said Wang.

	Latest statistics from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that the value added by China's major industrial firms increased 5.4 percent year on year in April, beating market expectations and posting an optimized structure.

	In addition, the purchasing managers' index for the manufacturing sector held steady at 50.1, remaining within the expansion range.

	NBS statistics also showed that profits of China's major industrial firms fell 3.7 percent year-on-year in April, thanks to a higher base in April last year and an earlier unleash of the market demand in March as lower value-added tax rate was implemented on April 1.

	Li Chao, an analyst with Huatai Research Institute, said that industrial profits would return to the positive territory, but how fast will depend on market demand, prices and the policy incentives of tax cuts and fee reductions.

	""Trade frictions may amplify short-term fluctuations but will not impact the long-term trend of asset prices based on what happened during the U.S.-Japan and U.S.-EU trade frictions,"" Li said.

	As enterprises may continue to foreload their exports, the data will not worsen in the second quarter, he said.

	BETTER STRUCTURE

	Based on figures from April, China's manufacturing sector has seen improving structure and efficiency. Among the 41 sub-sectors, 27 saw higher profits and 14 reported lower earnings in April.

	On the positive side, consumer product manufacturers and equipment producers maintained relatively fast profit growth, reflecting structural improvement.

	In the period, major special-purpose equipment producers recorded a 17.9 percent profit growth, while electrical machinery and device producers' profits climbed 14.5 percent.

	The structural change was in line with a shift in China's economic growth drivers from exports and investment to domestic consumption and high-end industries, analysts said.

	For every 100 yuan of revenue they generated, the costs they bore fell by 1.1 yuan from a year earlier to 88.7 yuan in April.

	Wang said that manufacturing firms' confidence had been enhanced thanks to the gradual unleashing of policy dividends as a result of the country's lower value-added tax rate.

	INNOVATION ENCOURAGED

	In the long run, innovation will be the main engine to propel the expansion of China's manufacturing industry. To encourage corporate innovation, China unveiled various measures, including establishing a series of innovation centers and laboratories, increasing support for enterprises in key fields and optimizing innovation-oriented policies.

	Wang said China will place greater emphasis on innovation in enterprises' development and urge them to increase research and development investment with more tax cuts and fund and loan issuances for innovation projects.

	More efforts will be made to facilitate research on core technologies, accelerate the intelligent, green and service-oriented upgrading of the manufacturing industry, and advance the integrated development of the manufacturing industry and industrial internet, Wang said.

	While enhancing resource sharing on various research platforms, the country will promote the application of scientific achievements, encourage domestic enterprises to carry out international innovation cooperation and intensify the protection of intellectual property.

	Despite the disruptions from the increased tariffs imposed by the United States, Wang said the country's manufacturing industry has a bright prospect.

	Official statistics showed that from January to April, actual foreign investment in China's manufacturing sector jumped 11.4 percent year on year.

	BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- China on Monday said it always maintained the position that any trade consultation with the United States should be based on the principles of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit.

	Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lu Kang made the remarks at a press briefing in response to U.S. President Donald Trump's recent remarks.

	Lu said for some time, the U.S. side, including some high-level personnel, has made various comments on China-U.S. trade consultations. Sometimes they said a trade deal would be reached, and sometimes they said there might be some difficulties in reaching a deal, he added.

	China's Belt & Road Initiative (BRI) is widely supported and welcomed by the Arab League.

	In the 8th Ministerial Meeting of the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum (CASCF) held in Beijing last July, China and Arab countries signed three important outcome documents including the Beijing Declaration, the Action Plan for 2018-2020 and the Declaration of Action on China-Arab States Belt and Road Cooperation.

	Earlier, China signed a nonbinding memorandum of understanding on the Belt and Road Initiative with 9 Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Iraq, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait, Lebanon, Egypt and Morocco. At the same time, cooperation documents on energy with 5 Arab countries including the United Arab Emirates, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Egypt were signed as well.

	Further, seven Arab countries including the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait and Egypt have become the founding members of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). The Arab countries and Arab League actively participated in the first Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in Beijing in May 2017.

	Through the continuous efforts, both sides have made significant progress in cooperation under the background of BRI.

	Take the progress of key infrastructure projects as an example, China and Arab Countries actively participated in many construction cooperative projects, for example Algeria central port, Egypt's ""10th of Ramadan"" suburban railway, the Egyptian main power grid transmission line, the Egyptian glass fiber production line and the Egyptian small satellite assembly test center.

	Besides, China and Arab Countries have made other achievements in areas such as the Abu Dhabi ports in United Arab Emirates, the extension of friendship port in Mauritania, the ""Mohamed VI bridge"" and the Morocco and China Reinforce Energy Cooperation in Morocco, the Road stadium in Qatar, the oil shale power station in Jordan, the independence power station project in Oman and the upper Atbara water conservancy project in Sudan.

	Financially, China has set up 15 billion US dollars of special loans (loans for special purpose) to support industrialization in the Middle East and 10 billion US dollars in concessional loans (loans on favorable terms). Meanwhile, China has set up RMB clearing centers in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, and has set up a joint investment fund totaling 20 billion US dollars with the two countries as well.

	With the efforts from both China and Arab Countries, the cooperation between them has made remarkable progress, for instance the Sino-Egyptian Suez Economic and Trade Cooperation Zone, the Sino-Arab Industrial Park in Oman, Saudi Arabia Industrial Agglomeration Zone, and the United Arab Emirates Capacity Cooperation Demonstration Park in China have been continuously promoted.

	On the other hand, China and Arab countries also focus on strengthening dialogue and consultation to exchange their bilateral development strategies and policies, and to push forward the BRI in line with the development strategies and policies of these countries based on their own situations.

	Countries have expectations for mutual benefits and win-win results from BRI. For instance, China and Arab countries highly benefited from each other in economic and trade exchanges. Specifically, in recent years, the business environment of Arab countries has been improved, and the governments have made great efforts to attract Chinese investors.

	Under this background, both China and Arab countries try to sign more BRI cooperation documents, such as the BRI and the ""2030 vision"" docking plan. Both China and Kuwait are working out a plan for bilateral cooperation. At the same time, the BRI projects have linked with other strategies like the Qatar's 2030 National Vision, Bahrain's Vision of 2030 Economic Development"", Egypt's Vision of 2030 Sustainable Development Strategy, Morocco's Economic Takeoff Plan and the Development Strategy of the Industrial Revitalization Plan 2014-2020.

	With the further development of BRI, it will also help the enterprises to actively express their expectations and demands as well as to participate in international economic governance.

	In terms of economic cooperation, China should actively promote a road towards peace and friendship by enhancing mutual understanding and trust as well as strengthening all-round exchanges. As China is committed to peace and cooperation, openness and inclusiveness, mutual learning and benefit, it promotes cooperation in all fields, and works to build a community of shared interests, destiny and responsibility featuring mutual political trust, economic integration and cultural inclusiveness.

	To keep the promise, China put forward proposals of policy coordination, facilities connectivity, unimpeded trade, financial integration and people-to people bond. Thus, BRI between China and Arab States is a road of building peace, prosperity, opening up, innovation and civilization between China and Arabia world, which helps expand the cooperation and serves the common interests of both sides. On the other hand, Arabian countries are supportive to the rules of the multilateral trading under the framework of WTO to achieve the goal of improving the sustainable development of all nations in the world.

	However, there are still some problems in China-Arab economic and trade cooperation such as the unstable political situation in different countries, chaos, economic policy, and government efficiency as well as the strict legal and compliance rules in the Middle East, which reduces the confidence of Chinese investors. Also, the prominent financial risks make financing difficult. All these instabilities hinder the progress and development of Chinese-funded enterprises in Arab countries.

	In this circumstance, the Chinese business community should strengthen its cooperation with the Arab commercial sector to standardize and give guidance to business activities under the framework of BRI.

	Namely, Chinese investors are to promote the dialogues with Arab countries on the basis of the existing industrial and commercial cooperation mechanism, with a focus on the safety, taxation, social security and employment restrictions for Chinese companies. Chinese companies should strengthen the investigation and analysis of the market environment, political, legal, cultural and religious situation of Arab countries to improve the risk evaluation and risk control.

	On the other hand, investors should build a good connection with legal agencies and committees to ensure the legitimate rights such as the intellectual property rights (IPR) of Chinese enterprises and prevent overseas legal disputes.

	To sum up, China and Arab countries should put forward the BRI on the basis of their own situations and characteristics. And all sides must adhere to an inclusive approach towards cooperation, and promote openness to achieve mutual benefits.

	DENVER, the United States, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade tensions with China are frustrating American farmers despite Washington's promise to make them ""one of the biggest beneficiaries.""

	The White House unveiled last week a 16-billion-U.S.-dollar aid package for farmers hurt by the ongoing trade row ignited and escalated by the United States.

	Yet the National Farmers Union said the ""temporary"" fix will not offset the ""permanent damage"" inflicted upon farmers losing a share of the Chinese market, and agricultural economists said it is self-destructive to U.S. interests.

	""It's difficult to see how U.S. farmers ... would be the biggest beneficiaries,"" said Anton Bekkerman, an agricultural economics expert at Montana State University.

	""We want markets, not tariffs, and have encouraged the administration to continue to work to resolve the trade war,"" said John Youngberg, a lifetime farmer and executive vice president of Montana Farm Bureau.

	""All my research finds that the protracted trade war is a net negative for American agriculture,"" he added.

	Despite the chorus of warnings, the U.S. administration of President Donald Trump has been reluctant to back away from such claims that trade wars are ""easy to win"" and will not damage ""long-term"" U.S. interests.

	""All the Trump administration's trade tactics have done is to hurt America's hardest working people,"" said David B. Richardson, a former member of the Florida House of Representatives.

	Voices of concern and calls for an early end of the U.S.-China trade row can be heard across America's ""farmbelt,"" which includes Iowa, a leading state in soybean output.

	""Soybean growers have been particularly hard hit and that is starting to spread to other markets,"" Youngberg told Xinhua.

	Grant Kimberley, a sixth-generation soybean farmer and marketing director of the Iowa Soybean Association, said he and his peers hope some quick and positive changes could be made.

	U.S. soybean exports to China have been down 89 percent over the past year, and about half of the supplies that would normally have gone to China have now gone somewhere else, with farmers ""still at a deficit for net total exports,"" Kimberley told Xinhua.

	""It's likely the trade dispute could be a long-term reality,"" he said. ""With prices going lower and soybean supplies growing, and with only modest hope that a resolution is near, we're likely to be mired in this scenario for some time.""

	""For some farmers, the crop they're currently planting may be their last,"" he said.

	If a cause is beneficial to society, it should be granted free development and broad competition, and the freer and broader the competition is, the more beneficial the cause would be to society. What Adam Smith says in the Wealth of Nations is still applicable to today’s world where economic globalization is going through in-depth development.

	However, it is shocking that some US politicians, worshiping technological hegemonism, are going against the trend of time, trying to narrow the space for international cooperation by refusing competitions. Their practices infringed upon the legitimate right of other countries to develop.

	Recently, the US government abused national power and frequently turned its gun toward Chinese high-tech enterprises that have climbed to the top of the world through hard work including Huawei. It banned Huawei from participating in the US construction of telecommunication equipment, especially 5G equipment with fabricated reasons such as the so-called theft of secrets and national security.

	The US administration later placed Huawei on the “Entity List”, forcing many American companies to cut supplies for the Chinese tech firm. Through the “presumption of denial”, it exerted extreme pressure on Huawei by national power, and even requested relevant enterprises to contain the latter. Such practice is totally unreasonable and overbearing.

	As a major technological and economic power in the world, the US should have understood the law of technological development and the benefit of market competition. However, the US politicians, ignoring such common sense on purpose, have made frequent attempts to interfere with technological cooperation and market competition.

	They resort to “national security” because they couldn’t find better excuses, which indicated the fragility of the largest tech power whose “national security” is opposed to threats so easily.

	It’s obvious that what the US really intends to do under the banner of the “national security” is to contain the development of China’s technology, so as to win more space and time for its own companies to gain monopoly in the global competition of 5G technology and the international division of labor.

	Such plot exactly exposed the hegemonic philosophy of the Uncle Sam that only allows itself to develop and refuses to accept the progress of the others. The practice indicated the supremacy that the US has always enjoyed as the only dominator of the world.

	There’s an old saying in China that strong men can conquer themselves. The best way to face competition is never containing the rivals, but improving self-capabilities. To maintain the leading position in technology, the US should make efforts to upgrade domestic enterprises and enhance their competitiveness.

	However, some Americans, represented by former White House Chief Strategist Stephen Bannon and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, talked nonsense that China presents “the greatest existential danger” ever to the US and “When China wants to supplant US dominance in an emerging industry, it acts rapaciously – it steals.” There is also voice in the US that “The race for 5G is on, and America must win.”

	As a matter of fact, by containing its rivals and cutting win-win cooperation with such mean approaches, the US will not see any progress made in its information technology, but only its enterprises being forced to use outdated and expensive substitutes, as well as slower steps in 5G construction.

	These unconventional methods can serve as a temporary “protecting umbrella”, but will never bring tangible development.

	A Scottish philosopher once compared “noble emulation” to the “source of every excellence”. The fundamental feature of market economy is emulation.

	A fair environment for competition can constantly stimulate the energy of market entities, facilitate the orderly flow of production factors, effective allocation of resources, and in-depth integration of markets, as well as promote the high-quality development of economy.

	It was through healthy competition that US carmakers Ford and General Motors both rose to fame and made remarkable achievements for the US auto industry at the beginning of the last century.

	The US, boasting its free competition and market economy, is taking competition so irrationally and ignoring international trade rules. How can it keep its credibility in the international society as it upholds trade protectionism and contains tech companies of other countries?

	The US refusal to competition impedes progress. Containing rivals won’t help itself maintain dominance, and it would not stay at an invincible position by adopting unconventional approaches either.

	The hegemonic US politicians should try to figure out why the US firms in the Silicon Valley are still sparing no efforts to make shipments to China before the Huawei ban takes effect despite the US attempts to stop Chinese companies from participating in global competition.

	They should also try to understand why global countries are still choosing to cooperate with Huawei despite the US-fabricated stories tarnishing the company.

	The reason, which is quite simple, is that cooperation leads to win-win situation that can enlarge the cake of interests for each party involved, and refusal to competition would only impact the global supply chain and create unnecessary risks for world economy.

	Decades ago, China broke the western blockade and made its own nuclear bombs, intercontinental ballistic missile, and artificial satellite. Today, the country’s steps of technological innovation still won’t be stopped by the disturbance from US politicians.

	The attempts to stop the strong impetus of China’s progress by hegemony or infringe upon the legitimate right of the country’s development by blockade are destined to fail.

	The trend of history is irreversible, and the mean approaches of the US will not help it maintain the leading position.

	NEW YORK, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Kevin Cheung, vice president of a New York-based clothing firm, recently twisted his ankle and is steadily recovering from an intense burning sensation on it.

	Yet there are no signs of easing of the ""slow burn"" that his company, Lisa International, has suffered since the United States initiated tariff disputes with China last March.

	As Washington increased additional tariffs on 200 billion U.S. dollars' worth of Chinese imports from 10 percent to 25 percent earlier in May and threatened to raise tariffs on more Chinese imports, this worsening trade row between the world's two largest economies has prolonged market uncertainty.

	""Clothing tariff is still not in place yet, but we assume it will be here soon. This is a bigger concern to me,"" Cheung told Xinhua in a recent interview.

	CATASTROPHIC IMPACT

	Cheung's concern was shared by a growing number of U.S. industry leaders who warned the White House of the ""catastrophic"" impact of such trade disputes on Americans with rising costs and dwindling profits.

	""This latest escalation means the trade war will only get worse and hit home for every American,"" said a statement released on May 13 by the Tariffs Hurt the Heartland campaign, which comprises over 150 U.S. trade organizations.

	Tariffs are taxes paid by American businesses and consumers, and they force American consumers to pay more for clothes, shoes, toys, electronics and even food while making it more difficult for U.S. exporters to compete, it said.

	""The trade war has gone on for far too long, and the costs have grown far too high. The patience of farmers, manufacturers, businesses and consumers is wearing thin, "" it said.

	Grant Kimberley, a sixth-generation soybean farmer and marketing director of the Iowa Soybean Association, said he and his peers hope some quick and positive changes could be made.

	U.S. soybean exports to China have been down 89 percent over the past year, and about half of the supplies that would normally have gone to China have now gone somewhere else, with farmers ""still at a deficit for net total exports,"" Kimberley told Xinhua.

	""It's likely the trade dispute could be a long-term reality,"" he said. ""With prices going lower and soybean supplies growing, and with only modest hope that a resolution is near, we're likely to be mired in this scenario for some time.""

	""For some farmers, the crop they're currently planting may be their last,"" he said.

	Washington's tariff hikes will also hit the U.S. toy industry hard given ""how heavily we rely on China for toy manufacturing and how thin the profit margins already are,"" said Rebecca Mond, vice president of federal government affairs at the Toy Association, a 950-plus-membered industry group.

	AGGRESSIVE BUT COUNTERPRODUCTIVE

	The U.S. position on solving trade disputes with China by using tariffs is ""very aggressive"" but ""counterproductive,"" said Steve Hoffman, a veteran investor and CEO of Founders Space, a leading incubator and accelerator in Silicon Valley.

	""Right now, the negative impacts of the U.S.-China trade conflicts are broadening beyond (U.S.) agriculture and beyond commodities, like steel and other stuff, into consumer electronics and other areas. And that could have a big impact in my home turf which is Silicon Valley,"" Hoffman told Xinhua.

	U.S. tariffs on tech product imports from China increased fivefold from 2017 to 2018, said Stefanie Holland, vice president for federal and global policy of the Computing Technology Industry Association.

	""Should a 25-percent tariff rate apply to all tech product imports the costs could run into the tens of billions of dollars,"" said Holland, adding that barriers to trade will also ""negatively impact the products that are designed, developed and manufactured in the United States.""

	According to a recent report by Swiss investment bank UBS, over 12,000 U.S. brick-and-mortar stores of apparels and textiles would be at risk because of the possible new tariffs.

	The big wave of store closures would be highly negative and create intense inventory dislocations and discounting in addition to impacts on jobs and the economy, the report said.

	The Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, a trade organization, estimated the new tariffs could cost U.S. consumers 7 billion dollars a year.

	""It is time to bring this trade war to an end,"" said an open letter signed by 173 footwear companies and retailers.

	In a study released Thursday, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said U.S. tariff revenue collected from levies on Chinese goods ""has been borne almost entirely by U.S. importers.""

	""The bilateral trade deficit remains broadly unchanged,"" it added.

	The latest U.S. tariff hikes will impose a total annual cost of 831 dollars for a typical U.S. household, said a research posted Thursday by the Federal Reserve (Fed) Bank of New York.

	""In sum, according to our estimates, these higher tariffs are likely to create large economic distortions and reduce U.S. tariff revenues,"" it said.

	YEARN FOR NORMAL TRADE

	Frustrated by disrupted U.S.-China trade, U.S. soybean farmers yearn for ""trading as normal"" with China, President of the American Soybean Association Davie Stephens told Xinhua.

	It took U.S. farmers more than 40 years to build the soybean market in China, said Stephens, warning that it will become ""increasingly difficult to recover"" as the U.S.-China trade row rumbles on.

	""The tariffs need to be removed. Let's get back to trading in an open market. That's free trade for both sides,"" he said.

	""To decouple the American and Chinese economies would be an economic disaster, damaging each country and the entire world,"" Chairman of the Kuhn Foundation Robert Kuhn told Xinhua.

	Concurring with Kuhn, Sourabh Gupta, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Institute for China-America Studies, said ""it is utterly unrealistic to uncouple China and the U.S. economically. The two economies are symbiotically connected and are too interdependent to be pried apart.""

	Criticizing Washington for pushing its trade partners into a ""win-lose situation,"" Hoffman said mutually respectful trade ""is the whole principle behind our system. And I think that principle still holds.""

	""In fact, such trade wars are just disruptive to business on both sides, which created uncertainty, confusion, and the whole supply chains and everything that businesses have planned for get turned upside down,"" he said.

	BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- China on Friday said it deeply sympathizes with U.S. farmers and ranchers for problems they had been encountering, but bears no blame for the problems.

	Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lu Kang made the remarks at a news briefing in response to media reports that U.S. Senator Jerry Moran recently said in his recommendations to the U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue that the net farm income had fallen by 50 percent since 2013 and many farmers and ranchers were on the verge of financial collapse.

	Moran asked to resolve the ongoing trade dispute with China, saying another round of assistance may provide short term relief for farmers, but will not make up for lost export markets and long term implications of the trade disputes.

	""For the problems the U.S. agricultural and livestock industry practitioners have been encountering, their Chinese counterparts deeply sympathize with that,"" Lu said.

	China and the U.S. have developed good cooperation in a wide range of fields including agriculture for a long time, which has benefited the industries and consumers of both sides, Lu said.

	He said the demands of the U.S. organizations of relevant industries, including agricultural and livestock, had shown their clear understanding that China was not responsible for the obstacles blocking the mutual beneficial cooperation between the two countries, as well as preventing China and the U.S. from resolving differences through friendly consultations and advancing common interests.

	The Chinese government had to take measures to protect its legitimate rights and interests when they get violated, just the same as the other countries' governments, he added.

	LEXINGTON, the United States, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Several U.S. governors have expressed their hope that the United States and China could soon reach a win-win trade deal to reduce uncertainty in business and bring bilateral cooperation back on track.

	""Of all the 50 states, more exports go to China from Washington state than any other state. And then similarly, China is our number one export destination of all the countries,"" Cyrus Habib, lieutenant governor of the U.S. state of Washington, told Xinhua on the sidelines of the just-concluded Fifth China-U.S. Governors Forum.

	""Our relationship with China is absolutely key, central to the success that we have had,"" Habib said. ""It's important for all different sectors of our economy.""

	When asked how he views the decline in bilateral trade volume since the trade dispute, Habib said ""it's a concern in both directions,"" adding that additional tariffs are definitely ""a source of stress"" for both Chinese and U.S. companies.

	""What businesses want and what workers need is predictability and an environment that reduces barriers,"" said the lieutenant governor.

	Former Missouri Governor Bob Holden also highlighted the disruption, saying that America's heartland, where the U.S. agricultural economy grows out of, has been severely hit by the trade dispute.

	Holden, currently chairman and CEO of the United States Heartland China Association, told Xinhua that 18 out of the 20 U.S. states located between the Great Lakes and the Gulf of Mexico are ""the hardest hit"" by tariffs stemming from U.S.-China trade friction.

	Holden said ""there's a great deal of concern, (and) uneasiness"" on the part of lots of soybean producers in Missouri, as well as some other agricultural areas. The former governor urged the two sides to resolve the issue so that things could go back to normal.

	Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin, whose state hosted the three-day forum, said ""there's no governor in America, not myself or any other governor that does not want these agreements to be done and done soon,"" adding that the trade dispute is hurting companies because of the uncertainty.

	""When you consider that the U.S. economy and the Chinese economy together comprise 40 percent of the world's GDP ... it is critical that we resolve at the national level anything that separates our nations,"" Bevin said.

	""We have 9,000 people in Kentucky working for Chinese-owned companies and hundreds have been added just in recent months. This is good. I want more. I want thousands more,"" he said.

	In order to reach a trade deal, Holden said, the two sides are ""going to have to feel like they both gave something and they both gained something from it.""

	""I think they've got to look at it from the standpoint that what can we do and what can they do to both serve our self-interest and not undermine the credibility of the other,"" said Holden.

	The former Missouri governor's remarks were echoed by Habib, who believes a possible trade deal should be beneficial to both sides.

	""What do we need to be doing? ... That's a conversation (which) needs to go in both directions,"" Habib said, stressing the importance of mutual respect which is needed ""at the heart of any negotiation.""

	A trade deal, Habib said, should help both sides have a good long-term understanding about trade dynamics, renew and refresh the rules of engagement, and make sure that ""to the best of our abilities, we facilitate imports and exports.""

	Bevin said that the two governments need to make sure that the trade agreement is ""proper"" and ""solid,"" and that both sides ""get something and give something.""

	The trade deal needs to be capable of lasting for years to come, Bevin added, saying that he is confident the trade dispute will eventually be settled.

	""At the national level, there'll be solutions,"" said Tennessee Governor Bill Lee, adding that he believes negotiations will be beneficial to both countries and his role is to enhance and develop those relationships in sub-national way.

	""I'm very optimistic about it,"" Habib said, ""because I've seen it work and I know that there's a strong desire in both national governments to resolve this.""

	""We can't let something that happens in one day or one week determine how we view one another. We have to have a long term view,"" Habib said.

	BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Some American politicians are trying to incite ideological opposition, but the differences of ideologies do not necessarily hinder cooperation in economy and trade, industry as well as science and technology between countries, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lu Kang said Friday.

	According to reports, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Thursday in an interview that Huawei Technologies is deeply tied to Chinese government and the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the existence of those connections puts American information that crosses those networks at risk.

	""For some time, certain American politicians have repeatedly mongered rumors about Huawei, but they have never been able to provide evidence demanded by other countries,"" Lu said at a press briefing in response to Pompeo's assertion.

	The U.S.-initiated trade and science and technology wars also face increasingly more questioning in the U.S. for causing market turmoil and hindering industrial cooperation.

	""Under such circumstances, those politicians continue to fabricate lies of subjective presumptions to mislead the American public, and now they are trying to incite ideological opposition,"" said Lu.

	""But this is illogical,"" he said. ""Isn't it a fact that the past U.S. administrations of both parties have been working with the CPC-led Chinese government to promote, expand and deepen mutually beneficial cooperation in all fields since the two countries forged diplomatic ties 40 years ago?"" He added that such cooperation has brought substantive benefits to the U.S. business circle and consumers.

	""In fact, the first batch of intergovernmental cooperation agreements signed by China and the U.S. at the beginning of the establishment of diplomatic relations included the China-U.S. Agreement on Cooperation in Science and Technology,"" he noted.

	On the other hand, he added, both the ""Prism gate"" incident and the Alstom case proved that the so-called ""convergence of ideology"" did not prevent the U.S. from taking various devious means against its allies.

	NEW YORK, May 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. tariff revenue collected from levies on Chinese goods ""has been borne almost entirely by U.S. importers,"" a study by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has found.

	The study, released on Thursday, said previously imposed tariffs have reduced trade between the United States and China, but ""the bilateral trade deficit remains broadly unchanged.""

	The study also said some of the additional tariffs have been passed on to U.S. consumers, while others have been absorbed by importing firms through lower profit margins.

	""Consumers in the U.S. and China are unequivocally the losers from trade tensions,"" the study said.

	Earlier this month, the United States increased additional tariffs on 200 billion U.S. dollars' worth of Chinese imports from 10 percent to 25 percent, and has threatened to raise tariffs on more Chinese imports.

	In response, China has announced that it will raise additional tariffs on a range of U.S. imports from June 1, and ""will fight to the end.""

	""A further increase in tariffs will likely be similarly passed through to consumers,"" the IMF study said.

	""While the impact on global growth is relatively modest at this time, the latest escalation could significantly dent business and financial market sentiment, disrupt global supply chains, and jeopardize the projected recovery in global growth in 2019.""

	NEW YORK, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The latest round of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods will impose a total annual cost of 831 U.S. dollars for a typical U.S. household, according to a research posted Thursday on the Federal Reserve (Fed) Bank of New York's website.

	The study was co-authored by Mary Amiti, assistant vice president in New York Fed's research and statistics group, Stephen Redding, professor in economics at Princeton University, and David Weinstein, professor of the Japanese economy at Columbia University.

	According to the research, increased tariffs in 2018 imposed an annual cost of 419 dollars for the typical U.S. household, with an added tax burden for consumers and a deadweight or efficiency loss as the two components.

	The study also found that a 10 percent tariff reduced import demand by 43 percent.

	The researchers estimated that the annualized deadweight loss will increase to 620 dollars per household with higher tariffs imposed.

	""In sum, according to our estimates, these higher tariffs are likely to create large economic distortions and reduce U.S. tariff revenues,"" according to the research.

	Founder and CEO of Huawei Ren Zhengfei took part in a group interview on May 21 at the company headquarters in Shenzhen, in southern China's Guangdong province.

	

	Ren Zhengfei (Photo/CCTV)

	It was Ren's first interview with domestic media after Washington placed the company and its affiliates on the ""Entity List"" which requires any US company to gain government approval before doing business with the Chinese tech company.

	During the interview, Ren responded to hot issues such as 5G, chips, and the current US ban on Huawei.

	The US Department of Commerce added Huawei and 70 affiliates to its so-called ""Entity List"" for national security reasons on May 15, and granted a 90-day temporary license, loosening restrictions on business deals with the Chinese tech giant.

	The following are extracts from the interview.

	

	(xinsheng.huawei.com)

	CCTV: Just now, another media representative took out a photo of a bullet-ridden aircraft. I was also given this same photo. I heard that you like this photo very much, the photo of the badly damaged fighter aircraft.

	Ren: I first saw this photo on wukong.com, feeling that the aircraft was quite like our company. So I sent it to my colleagues. The Carrier BG thought the aircraft in this photo is akin to its situation and started using it for communications.

	Later, we found that there were not many problems with the Carrier BG, since it has been getting fully prepared over these past 10-plus years. So our current situation is that we are repairing our ""aircraft"" during its flight so that it can make its way back home.

	CCTV: But this aircraft was able to fly back, because its vital parts, such as its fuel tanks and engines, were not damaged. Only the non-vital parts of its wings were damaged. But if its vital parts were attacked during a flight, how was it possible for it to make its way back?

	Ren: I want to tell you two stories about Germany and Japan during World War II. Germany refused to surrender, so its cities were flattened by air-strikes. Japan was also attacked by intensive bombardments. The US army threatened that if Japan did not give up, intense bombing would also flatten the country. At the end of the day, Japan decided upon a compromise, which was to announce the country's surrender but keep their Emperor. By the time the surrender came, the majority of Japan's industrial infrastructure was destroyed, but the country did not suffer the fate of being leveled like Germany.

	Back then, there was a famous slogan: ""Even if everything else is lost, as long as people remain, they will revitalize the nation."" The truth is, Germany was able to revitalize its economy and restore all its houses to the extent before the war in just a few years. The Japanese economy also recovered very quickly. This was attributable to their talent, education systems, and foundation. This is what matters most. So even if we lose everything else, we can't lose our talent. This includes their qualities, skills, and confidence. This is very important.

	CCTV: Yesterday (US time), the US issued a temporary license to Huawei. In other words, its restrictions on Huawei can be lifted in the following 90 days. What's your view on this license? What could you do in these 90 days? If the news is true and the US cancelled the imposed restrictions after 90 days, how would you comment on such a reversal?

	Ren: First of all, 90 days doesn't mean much to us, and we have prepared. To us, the most important thing is to do our job well. What the US will do is out of our control. I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the US companies that we work with. Over these 30 years, they have helped us to grow into what we are today. They have made many contributions to us. As you know, most of the companies that provide consulting services to Huawei are based in the US, including dozens of companies like IBM and Accenture.

	Second, we also have been receiving support from a large number of US component and part manufacturers over all these years. In the face of the recent crisis, I can feel these companies' sense of justice and sympathy towards us.

	The US has added Huawei to the Entity List. That is to say if a US company wants to sell something to Huawei, it needs to obtain approval from the US government.

	The US is a country ruled by law. US companies must abide by the laws, and so must the real economy. So you guys from the media should not always blame US companies. Instead, you should speak for them. The blame should rest with some US politicians.

	US politicians might have underestimated our strengths. I don't want to say too much about this, because Ms. He Tingbo, President of HiSilicon, made all these issues very clear in her letter to employees. And all mainstream newspapers inside and outside of China have reported on this letter.

	You touched upon the damaged aircraft just now. We have some non-core products for which we haven't prepared ""spare tires"", or Plan Bs, so to speak. These products will be phased out sooner or later. So the US move will have some impact on these products. But in sectors where we have the most advanced technologies, at least in the 5G sector, there won't be much impact. Not just that, our competitors won't be able to catch up with us within two to three years.

	People's Daily: I want to ask a question about chips. I noticed that you said in an interview with Japanese media on May 18 that ""Huawei does not need chips from the US. There is no problem with Huawei."" Can I ask where your strengths come from and what you have done to prepare?

	Ren: First, we are always in need of US chips. Our US partners are fulfilling their responsibilities and asking for approval from Washington. If this approval is granted, we will still buy chips from these suppliers. We may even sell chips to US companies (to help the US make more advanced products). We won't exclude our US partners or seek to grow entirely on our own. Instead, we will grow together.

	Even if there is an insufficient supply from our partners, we will face no problems. This is because we can manufacture all the high-end chips we need ourselves. In the ""peaceful period"", we adopted a ""1+1"" policy – half of our chips come from US companies and half from Huawei. Despite the much lower costs of our own chips, I would still buy higher-priced chips from the US. We cannot be isolated from the world. Instead, we should become part of it.

	Our close relationships with US companies are the result of several decades of effort on both sides. These relationships won't be destroyed by a piece of paper from the US government. As long as these companies can obtain approval from Washington, we will continue to buy in large volumes from them. It may be the case that they cannot obtain approval quickly. Once approval is granted, we will maintain our normal trade with these US companies and work together to build an information society for humanity. We don't want to work alone.

	Xinhua News Agency: You once said that Huawei wouldn't be working behind closed doors and would cooperate with others. Now you are saying that Huawei will be doing both things. Does this mean that US trade protectionism and the US ban on Huawei are essentially disrupting global supply chains and causing chaos in the market? What do you think are the focus areas of criticisms against Huawei? Why are they targeting Huawei?

	Ren: I don't know exactly what those US politicians are thinking. I think we should not be the target of US-led campaigns just because we are ahead of the US. 5G is not an atomic bomb; it's something that benefits society.

	In terms of network capacity, 5G is 20 times larger than 4G and 10,000 times larger than 2G. The power consumption per bit of our 5G base station is ten times lower than 4G, and the size is 70% smaller. Our 5G base station is very small indeed, about the same size as a briefcase. It's also light – about 20 kilograms. You don't have to build a cell phone tower for 5G base stations, because they can be installed anywhere – on poles or walls. They can work for decades because they are made of anti-corrosion materials. This means that our 5G equipment can be installed even in underground sewage systems. It is especially suitable for European markets, where there are many areas with historical buildings and it's impossible to build giant cell phone towers like those in China. Of course, the existing towers in China won't lay idle, because our 5G base stations can be installed on them too – it's just that we don't need to build new towers.

	With our 5G base stations, our customers in Europe can reduce their engineering costs by 10,000 euros per site. They won't need to use cranes for installation, and they won't need to build cell phone towers. In the past, our customers had to use cranes to install huge pieces of base station equipment, and the surrounding roads had to be blocked off during the installation process. Now, they can easily install our 5G base stations by hand. It's super easy.

	The bandwidth of 5G is very high – so high that it can support a huge amount of high-definition content and easily transmit 8K video. They're saying that 5G will reduce costs tenfold; in fact it's more like 100-fold. This means that ordinary people can watch high-definition TV programs, and they can learn a lot from these programs. To develop further, every country needs to rely on culture, philosophy, and education. These form the foundation of national development. Therefore, 5G will change our society for the better. Latency on 5G networks is extremely low, so 5G will be rapidly adopted in many industries for all sorts of purposes.

	While there might be ""holes"" in our aircraft wings, we will continue to focus on developing our core and to lead the world in these areas. The more advanced a product is, the more comprehensive its Plan B will be.

	Global Times: The letter from HiSilicon President has created a lot of excitement in the media. People in the chipset industry take an objective approach to the gaps between companies in China, the US, and other countries in terms of chips and other core components. What do you think is the position of Huawei's in-house products and R&D? The letter also gave an assurance that Huawei can ensure supply continuity. Is that assurance true?

	Ren: I think that if you feel worked up about something, you should start by taking a cold shower. In my opinion, what's most important is to be calm and level-headed.

	It's worth learning from US companies in terms of their depth and breadth in science and technology. We lag far behind in many aspects. Some small US companies are providing super advanced products. We have only focused on our business and become a leader, but we haven't attempted to compare ourselves to the US as a nation. On a business level, I think the gap is quite small between Huawei and certain US companies. On the national level, however, there are huge gaps between China and the US.

	The Paper: Records show that HiSilicon was established in 2004. After so many years of efforts, you can produce your own chips for many purposes. How did you or Huawei decide to make your own chips? Ms. He said that Huawei began planning for the most extreme conditions many years ago. How well can you serve customers if the US companies stop supplying chips to you?

	Ren: In early 2000, we decided to sell Huawei to a US company for about 10 billion US dollars. A contract was signed with this company, and all relevant procedures were completed. The deal was ready to be completed once it received the approval of the US company's Board of Directors.

	While we were waiting, the Board of Directors of the US company was reelected. Their new board chair was somewhat short-sighted and rejected the acquisition deal. After this deal failed, our senior executives were deciding whether to sell Huawei to someone else. All of our younger executives unanimously said no. I could not reject this, so I replied, ""We will have to square off against the US when we reach the top. We need to get prepared."" Since then, we have been considering the question of what happens when we meet the US at the top, and have begun to make preparations for this. That said, we will ultimately embrace each other because we want to work together with them to make contributions to society.

	BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- In the name of ""fair trade,"" trade hawks in Washington are waging a global assault on the flow and the spirit of free trade.

	Because of Washington's hegemonic hubris, the global economy is under huge downward pressure, and the long-established international rules that govern global trade transactions are in serious jeopardy.

	""We will not allow the WTO Appellate Body and dispute settlement system to force the United States into a straitjacket of obligations to which we never agreed,"" said the Office of the United States Trade Representative in a March 2019 report, a public demonstration of insolence.

	With China in the crosshairs of U.S. tariffs, such U.S. allies as the European Union, Canada, South Korea and Japan also cannot get away. ""With friends like that, who needs enemies?"" European Council President Donald Tusk spoke of Washington at a news conference in May 2018.

	The principles of equality and consultation are instrumental in maintaining international economic and trade relations. It means that for a trade deal to succeed, all parties, while respecting market choices, need to treat each other as equals and respect their legitimate demands. It seems that the United States does not care about that.

	As Washington is bullying its trading partners worldwide, it is also damaging the already gloomy prospects of global economic recovery.

	A minor global trade war where tariffs rise 10 percent would reduce GDP of most countries by 1-4.5 percent, and a 40-percent hike in tariffs would cause a deep global recession, according to an August 2017 paper co-authored by Warwick J. McKibbin from the Australian National University.

	""The Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930 comes to mind,"" said McKibbin in an op-ed of the Brookings Institution. The tariff nine decades ago further fueled protectionism worldwide and drove the economy deeper into the Great Depression. ""It was driven by similar isolationists arguments that the Trump Administration now relies on.""

	As other parts of the world face the crunch, it has too taken a toll on the United States. By the end of 2018, import tariffs were costing U.S. consumers and the firms that import foreign goods an additional 3 billion U.S. dollars per month in added tax costs, according to a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Princeton University and Columbia University.

	""By now, it is likely no surprise to American families that tariffs raise the cost of living,"" said Mary E. Lovely, a professor at Syracuse University, in March in a CNN article. ""These tariffs burden American households and producers and offer no relief from the problems they were supposed to solve.""

	A nation keen to flex muscles may get some unwilling concessions in the short term. In the long run, its credibility will go down the drain.

	""A country's attractiveness is based on the deeds of that country's leadership rather than on its culture and political value,"" said Yan Xuetong, a professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing, in his new book ""Leadership and the Rise of Great Powers.""

	""This argument can explain why US soft power declined so dramatically after the Trump administration had been in office for only half a year, even though American culture and political values remained the same,"" he argued.

	In the face of Washington's aggressive trade policies, many around the world have begun to fight back.

	WTO Director-General Roberto Azevedo in September 2018 said countries have already launched roughly 30 disputes at the WTO that year, the most since 2002, among which about 20 of the cases stem from the tariffs Washington imposed on other WTO members.

	As Washington further escalates trade tensions, China will join hands with others around the world to reject its bullyism, uphold multilateralism and share development opportunities. At the end of the day, the trade warmongers in Washington will know that a trade war is bad, and nobody will win.

	PARIS, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on Tuesday warned that a trade war would threaten the global economic outlook for 2019 and 2020.

	The Paris-based intergovernmental economic organization urged the world's leading economies to enhance cooperation and multilateral dialogue to stimulate growth.

	Being broadly more pessimistic than March when the last report was published, the OECD projected that the world economic growth rate will lose 0.1 percentage point to 3.2 percent this year, its lowest since 2015. As for 2020, it kept the 3.4-percent growth unchanged.

	""Growing trade tensions drive uncertainty, thus business investment is hit and global growth is stifled,"" OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurria said in his opening remarks at the 2019 OECD Forum held on May 20-21 in Paris.

	""This in turn will undermine people's well-being: jobs will be disrupted and consumers' purchasing power will be hurt,"" he said. ""The world economy is in a dangerous place, unless there is a de-escalation of trade tensions.""

	The OECD figures showed world trade -- a key artery of the global economy -- would grow 2.1 percent this year, a 10-year low. That would negatively impact manufacturing, disrupt global value chains and generate significant uncertainty that would weigh on investment decisions.

	""We must reinforce transparent, predictable and rules-based trade. Waves of trade liberalization have benefited people around the world, with something like a billion people lifted out of poverty, new industries and new markets created across the globe,"" Gurria said.

	""So, there is urgent work to do at the multilateral table to ensure that trade can continue to underpin global and inclusive growth,"" he added.

	In the name of protecting domestic industries, the United States has placed steep tariffs on billions of U.S. dollars' worth of products from its major partners, including the European Union, Canada, China and Japan, raising trade tensions around the world and shaking the foundation of the global trading system.

	""The fragile global economy is being destabilized by trade tensions. Growth is stabilizing, but the economy is weak and there are very serious risks on the horizon,"" said OECD Chief Economist Laurence Boone.

	""Governments need to work harder together to ensure a return to stronger and more sustainable growth,"" Boone added.

	WASHINGTON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Although U.S. technology product exports to China increased in 2018, the escalating trade tensions between the two countries may drag down the U.S. economic growth and harm U.S. manufacturers, an industry report released on Tuesday showed.

	The U.S. technology product exports to China increased by 4.9 percent to 17.9 billion U.S. dollars in 2018, and the U.S. technology services to China increased by 3.9 percent to 2.2 billion dollars in 2017, according to the report by Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA), a leading trade association for the global technology industry.

	However, the U.S.-China trade dispute has resulted in tariffs on tech product imports from China increasing fivefold from 2017 to 2018, said Stefanie Holland, vice president for federal and global policy of the association.

	""Should a 25-percent tariff rate apply to all tech product imports the costs could run into the tens of billions of dollars,"" said Holland.

	In the latest flare-up of U.S.-China trade tensions, Washington increased additional tariffs on 200 billion U.S. dollars' worth of Chinese imports from 10 percent to 25 percent earlier this month, and threatened to raise tariffs on more Chinese imports.

	In response, China has announced that it will raise additional tariffs on a range of U.S. imports from June 1, and ""will fight to the end.""

	Calling on the United States and China to reach a deal, Holland said barriers to trade do not foster long-term economic growth and will continue to negatively impact the products that are designed, developed and manufactured in the United States.

	The U.S. technology exports directly supported an estimated 858,000 American jobs in 2017, according to the report. A previous report from CompTIA said that there were more than 11.8 million people with technology jobs in the United States in 2018.

	The US government's 90-day extension ""doesn't mean much"".

	We can make chips as good as those made by US companies, but it does not mean that we will not buy chips from them.

	Huawei's 5G plan will not be affected by the US ban.

	Don't fan nationalist sentiment.

	Ren Zhengfei, founder and CEO of Huawei, said on Tuesday that the US government's 90-day extension ""doesn't mean much"", adding that the company was ready to deal with the ban.

	Ren's comments came after the US Commerce Department said on Monday that it gave Huawei a 90-day license to purchase US technologies to maintain existing networks and provide software updates to existing Huawei handsets. That marks a delay of the ban on US technology exports to Huawei.

	Chinese manufacturers should speed up efforts to become key suppliers of high-tech, high-end parts to the global market, while setting up new industrial chains in countries and regions along the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to cope with the escalation of the China-US trade war, industry insiders suggested.

	

	On the afternoon of February 25, 2019，in the Haicang supply chain platform of Yiwu Bonded Logistics Center, the staff is packing Korean cosmetics that have been ordered for sale in China.

	Domestic companies should climb up the value chain, moving from producing labor-intensive goods and low-end parts to high-end products, said Xu Shanda, former deputy commissioner of the State Taxation Administration. He made the comment at the ongoing Global Supply Chain Summit 2019 in Fuzhou, capital of East China’s Fujian Province, over the weekend of May 18 and 19.

	“The strategy will help them gain a firm foothold in global competition, rather than [being replaced in the] global supply chain due to the protracted tariff war,” Xu explained. Some are concerned that the US’ trade war with China could squeeze Chinese companies out of the global supply chain.

	On May 10, the US raised tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods and products from 10 percent to 25 percent. In response, China retaliated, announcing tariffs ranging between 5 percent and 25 percent on 5,140 US-originated products worth $60 billion.

	Zhang Yansheng, chief research fellow with the China Center for International Economic Exchanges, told the Global Times on the sidelines of the forum that while some low-end OEM production lines may leave China [to avoid US tariffs], most manufacturers that are market-oriented and those that have already embarked on their own innovations will stay.

	For example, the Fujian-based Fuyao Glass has been one of the most profitable auto glass suppliers in the world thanks to its innovation in producing hydrophobic glass and glass that is resistant to freezing, Xu said.

	Meanwhile, BRI countries and regions are pivotal in strengthening China’s role in the global supply chain, according to industry insiders.

	“About 70 percent of Huawei’s sales are from BRI countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America, where most multinational corporations are absent. It is in those markets that Huawei has transformed and upgraded and risen to an upper position in the global supply chain,” Zhang said, suggesting Chinese manufacturers should take a similar road to help BRI regions prosper.

	Analysts attending the forum also pointed out that the trade war launched by the US will eventually lead to chaos in the global supply chain - at a cost to the US economy and companies.

	“The US has grossed tremendous benefits from its present position in the global supply chain. On the one hand, the cheaper imports help it to reduce the inflation rate and labor costs. On the other hand, US tech firms such as Apple have pocketed huge profits from the manufacturing chain,” Xu said.

	In the first four months of 2019, foreign investment in Chinese manufacturing increased by 11.4 percent when compared with the same period last year, despite trade tensions between China and the US, according to official data.

	At the same time, China's actual use of foreign capital reached over 305 billion yuan ($44 billion), up 6.4 percent from the previous year.

	Benefiting from China's vast market, low operational costs, and sufficient labor sources, multiple foreign companies have witnessed their businesses thrive in the country and have said that they will continue to invest in China.

	""China is the largest single market in the world,"" said Li Jie, executive vice-president of the British car maker Jaguar Land Rover's Chinese company at the Expo Central China 2019.

	""The reason why we bring the latest and most cutting-edge technology to China is that we value the Chinese market and believe it holds great prospects,"" Li explained.

	""We've made huge profits in the Chinese market since we entered it three decades ago, and we will continue to expand and improve our business here,"" Wang Ping, director of Schneider Electric China, said at the expo.

	Earlier this year, China approved a new foreign investment law at the 13th National People's Congress to protect the rights and interests of overseas investors.

	Foreign companies will see more business opportunities brought by the negative list on the market access of foreign investment and the catalogue of foreign investment industries that are expected to be released by the end of this June.

	HOUSTON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- City and local level exchanges and cooperation have laid the foundation for healthy development of the U.S.-China relations, experts agreed at the fourth U.S.-China Innovation and Investment Summit (UCIS) held from Thursday to Friday.

	The summit attracted around 300 officials, experts and business leaders from the United States and China. Participants shared the view that the summit has set a platform for collaborations between small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) from the two countries.

	According to the Chinese Consul General in Houston Li Qiangmin, communication and cooperation between cities in China and the United States, particularly in science and technology, are an important part of the China-U.S. relations.

	""The summit has special meaning of solving the problem for U.S. small businesses to enter the Chinese market, as well as assisting the Chinese innovative companies to access the international market,"" said Li.

	According to U.S.-China Innovation Alliance (UCIA), the co-host of the summit, the event has expanded significantly since its first launch in 2016 and it has attracted more companies and scientific research institutions.

	Statistics show the event has facilitated more than 3,000 B2B matchmaking projects and reached over 300 cooperative intentions, with the participation of more than 100 innovative companies from both sides.

	David Firestein, inaugural executive director of China Public Policy Center in the University of Texas at Austin, believed that people-to-people and business-to-business exchanges are the basis of U.S.-China relations, adding that the summit has played a crucial role in promoting such exchanges.

	""They (cities, companies and individuals on both sides) work together every day in ways that you don't see headlines about and that we often forget about,"" noted Firestein, who is also the president and CEO of George H.W. Bush Foundation for U.S.-China Relations.

	As the honorary guest city of this year's summit, Changsha in Hunan Province of China led over 20 SMEs to matchmake with the U.S. companies in the fields of advanced manufacturing and biopharma and digital health &diagnosis.

	A memorandums of understanding (MoU) on cooperative relationship in technological development and cultural innovation was signed between Changsha and Austin, capital of the state of Texas as part of the UCIS.

	Steve Adler, mayor of Austin, said that city-level exchanges and cooperation can help promote understandings between the two countries, and city of Austin will do everything ""within the bounds available to us to maximize those opportunities.""

	In order to facilitate the energy business of the two countries, the U.S. National Center for Sustainable Development (NCSD) signed two MoUs with Chinese companies. The MoUs were signed between the NCSD and China Hainan Dayang International Energy Group Co. Ltd. and Zhuhai Dayang International Exchange Group respectively, to build trading platforms for petroleum and its derivatives between the two nations.

	Gong Jialong, CEO of Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area International Energy Exchange Co. Ltd., said China-U.S. cooperation in energy has great potential because ""China is the world's largest energy consumer and U.S. is one of the largest producers.""

	Highly praising the cooperation MoUs, NCSD Chairman Mitchell Stanley said the summit is an effective way for U.S. small businesses in energy industry to enter the international market.

	As a featured event of the summit, the third ""INNOSTARS"" preliminary competitions attracted dozens of U.S. SMEs to compete in four areas of science, health and technological innovations, including advanced manufacturing, biopharma and digital health &diagnosis, information and communication technology, as well as energy. The 12 winning enterprises will enter the grand final in China and explore their business opportunities on the other side of the Pacific.

	Jointly hosted by the China Science &Technology Exchange Center and U.S.-China Innovation Alliance, the two-day summit kicked off on Thursday and attracted around 300 participants from China and the United States, including entrepreneurs and investors.

	NEW YORK, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Escalating U.S.-China trade frictions would trigger negative spillover on global trade and the American economy, said two former U.S. officials.

	The worsening trade row between the world's two largest economies would cause disruptions in global supply chains as well as the two parties' ability to conduct business, according to Jacob Lew, who served as secretary of the Treasury from 2013 to 2017.

	""And then it spills over into geopolitical risk, which has a life of its own in terms of creating uncertainty. Uncertainty is not a great ingredient in a 10-year old recovery"" of the U.S. economy from the 2008 financial crisis, Lew said at a recent discussion event in New York.

	The United States has greatly benefited from being the issuer of the world's dominant reserve currency and the world's banking center for decades, noted the former secretary, who is currently a partner at Lindsay Goldberg, a U.S. private equity firm.

	He added that he believes Washington's unilateral tariffs and sanctions have ""created kind of blinking yellow lights around the world that is cautioning others from doing business"" in the country.

	The consequence goes beyond how many percent of GDP growth will be lost, said Lew. ""I think the long-term risks to the U.S. economy is quite, quite substantial.""

	In this regard, Donald Kohn, a 40-year veteran of the U.S. Federal Reserve System, held that the global stock markets and broader financial market would bear the brunt of any turbulence in U.S.-China trade relations.

	""We see the stock market go up and down with every rumor about what's happening to the trade deals. ... I think the stock market and financial markets will react to the potential,"" said Kohn, who is currently a senior fellow of economics at U.S. think tank Brookings Institution.

	He further elaborated that the United States has a trade deficit because the country is spending more than it produces, and it is importing stuff to satisfy the spending which they do not produce domestically.

	It is more of ""a fundamental macroeconomic fact"" than unfair trading practices, Kohn argued.

	Washington increased additional tariffs on 200 billion U.S. dollars' worth of Chinese imports from 10 percent to 25 percent earlier this month, and has threatened to raise tariffs on more Chinese imports.

	In response, China has announced that it will raise additional tariffs on a range of U.S. imports from June 1, and ""will fight to the end.""

	China has pointed out that it is the United States that started the trade disputes, and what China has done so far is purely self-defense to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests as well as to uphold multilateralism and the free trade system.

	Beijing has also urged the United States to carefully weigh its gains and losses, get back on the right track as soon as possible, and meet China halfway in achieving a mutually beneficial and win-win agreement on the basis of mutual respect.
